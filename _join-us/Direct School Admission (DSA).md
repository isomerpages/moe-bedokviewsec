<h5>Description and Criteria</h5>
<p><strong>Student Leadership</strong>
<br>The Student Leadership programme at Bedok View Secondary School is closely
linked to our school’s Learning for Life Programme (LLP), Good Values @BV
and it aims to develop students into confident and inspiring leaders. We
engage student leaders by equipping them with leadership skills so that
they can grow to be responsible and respectful leaders and citizens. We
also provide various platforms and opportunities for student leaders to
demonstrate their leadership skills and to serve the community.</p>
<p><strong>Media/Journalism &amp; Photography/Videography</strong>
<br>The Media/Journalism and Photography/Videography programmes in Bedok View
Secondary School are offered under the school’s Applied Learning Programme
(ALP), Global Awareness for the 21st Century @ BV. The ALP is a distinctive
school programme, which aims to nurture global citizens who are critical
thinkers and effective communicators. It does so by leveraging media and
journalism lessons, workshops and projects for students to be equipped
with media literacies, oratorical skills and broadcast journalism skills.
Students are provided with opportunities within school, as well as external
competitions and events, to apply the skills they have learned.</p>
<p><strong>Sports</strong>
<br>The sports programme in Bedok View Secondary School are offered under
the school’s CCA programme. Students selected under the Sports DSA categories
will join the respective school sports CCA group. Through the CCA training
programme, they will have various development platforms as well as competition
opportunities through the National Schools Games.
