##### Description and Criteria
**Student Leadership**<br>
The Student Leadership programme at Bedok View Secondary School is closely linked to our school’s Learning for Life Programme (LLP), Good Values @BV and it aims to develop students into confident and inspiring leaders. We engage student leaders by equipping them with leadership skills so that they can grow to be responsible and respectful leaders and citizens. We also provide various platforms and opportunities for student leaders to demonstrate their leadership skills and to serve the community.

**Media/Journalism &amp; Photography/Videography**<br>
The Media/Journalism and Photography/Videography programmes in Bedok View Secondary School are offered under the school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP), Global Awareness for the 21st Century @ BV. The ALP is a distinctive school programme, which aims to nurture global citizens who are critical thinkers and effective communicators. It does so by leveraging media and journalism lessons, workshops and projects for students to be equipped with media literacies, oratorical skills and broadcast journalism skills. Students are provided with opportunities within school, as well as external competitions and events, to apply the skills they have learned.

**Sports**<br>
The sports programme in Bedok View Secondary School are offered under the school’s CCA programme. Students selected under the Sports DSA categories will join the respective school sports CCA group. Through the CCA training programme, they will have various development platforms as well as competition opportunities through the National Schools Games.<br>
