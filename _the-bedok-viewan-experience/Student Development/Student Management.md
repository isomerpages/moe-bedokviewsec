<h3>Student Management Framework</h3>
<p>Effective discipline is based on a consistent philosophy and approach.
Every student matters and the school aims to nurture a caring school culture
and a positive school climate. Such a climate is based on a calm yet firm
insistence on high standards of behaviour at all times. To this effect,
the school has formulated a set of clear and reasonable school rules to
guide the students, which emphasises both reason and compassion, to help
students change for their betterment.</p>
<p>School discipline also means the obligation of teachers and students to
follow a code of conduct known usually as school rules. These regulations
define exactly what is expected of model student behaviour and the consequences
in the event that the student violates this standard. At the same time,
our school creates a supportive environment by teaching values, social
and emotional skills, and providing opportunities for students to exercise
good behaviour by guiding and re-orientating students who have erred in
their ways. A Whole School Approach towards Discipline is thus adopted,
with the aim of developing our students’ self-discipline so that they become
individuals who take responsibility for their decisions and actions.</p>
<h3>Our Discipline Approach</h3>
<p>The school has adopted the ‘4 P’ Framework to discipline, which stands
for being Proactive, Preventive, Pastoral and having good Partnerships
with parents and external agencies to enhance the quality of the school
as a community and to help maintain high expectations.</p>

<h3>Code Of Conduct</h3>
<p><strong>1. Attendance &amp; Punctuality</strong>
</p>
<p>1.1 Daily attendance in school during term time is compulsory as it supports
student learning. The same is expected for CCAs or any activity organised
by the school.
<br>
</p>
<p>1.2 Bedok Viewans must submit to their Form Teacher, upon their return
to school, a valid Medical Certificate or a Letter of Excuse (not more

a valid reason is considered as truancy.
<br>
</p>
<p>1.3 Bedok Viewans should obtain written permission from the Form Teacher
before leaving the school premises during curriculum time based on valid
reasons. Once approval has been given, he/she should proceed to the General
Office for his/her parents to be contacted.

<p>1.4 Bedok Viewans should be punctual for school, CCA and other school
activities. Late-comers may be required to serve detention and repeated
late-comers may be externally suspended.</p>
<p><strong>2. Flag Raising Ceremony</strong>

and take the National Pledge. Bedok Viewans will take the National Pledge
with the right fist placed over the heart.

Viewans who are improperly attired.</p>

<p><strong>6. Rule on Weapons</strong>
</p>
<p>6.1 Bedok Viewans are not allowed to have in their possession any weapon.
They are also not allowed to bring any weapon-like item which is used or
intended to be used to cause harm to others.</p>
<p><strong>7. Canteen Rules &amp; Cleanliness of School</strong>
</p>
<p>7.1 Bedok Viewans are not allowed to eat or drink outside the canteen
or the designated areas so as to maintain the cleanliness of the school's
environment.
<br>
</p>
<p>7.2 Bedok Viewans should queue in an orderly manner to buy food or drinks
in the canteen.
<br>
</p>
<p>7.3 Bedok Viewans are to make it their duty to return plates and cutlery
to the respective containers provided by the food stalls as this helps
in maintaining the general appearance and cleanliness of the canteen.
<br>
</p>
<p>7.4 Bedok Viewans are also expected to be responsible and considerate
in the use of all equipment and facilities within the school at all times.
<br>
</p>
<p>7.5 Any defacing of furniture or misuse of equipment is a serious offence
and is considered an act of vandalism. Offenders may be required to pay
for the repair or replacement of damaged property.</p>
<p><strong>8. Smoking</strong>
</p>
<p>8.1 Smoking is illegal for all individuals who are under the age of 21,
and it is also prohibited in public places within the compounds of educational
institutions.
<br>
</p>
<p>8.2 Smoking is a serious offence. We do not want Bedok Viewans to pick
up this unhealthy habit during their formative years in school. Students
caught smoking within or outside the school premises are liable to face
serious consequences in school.</p>
<p><strong>9. Behaviour in Public</strong>
</p>
<p>9.1 Bedok Viewans are to be respectful and courteous in public areas.
They are to observe and abide by the rules and regulations within the areas
that they are patronising and/or visiting.
<br>
</p>
<p>9.2 Bedok Viewans found violating these may face consequences meted out
by the school in addition to any any fines or punishments by the authorities,
in addition to consequences that the school will mete out.</p>
<p><strong>10. Use of Electronic Devices</strong>
</p>
<p>10.2 Students should seek permission from their parents and guardians
to bring these devices to school. Students are to take full responsibility
to look after the devices they own. The school will not be responsible
for any loss or damage to these devices.
<br>
</p>
<p>10.3 These devices should always be on silent mode when switched on.
<br>
</p>
<p>10.4 Charging of these devices, when they are not used for educational
purposes or related, is not allowed in school.
<br>
</p>
<p>10.5 Using these devices to take unwarranted photographs or videos of
any person in the school is not allowed. The same rule applies if these
devices are used to take unwarranted photographs or videos of any member
of public outside school.
<br>
</p>
<p>10.6 These devices can only be used during recess, after curriculum hours
and after school activities or events. If these devices have to be used
within curriculum hours or during school activities and events, the teachers
will grant permission to the students. Conversely, students may request
permission from their teachers for the use of the devices. Permission will
be granted on a case-by-case basis and the decisions of the teachers will
be final.
<br>
</p>
<p>10.7 The staff of the school has the right to confiscate these devices
if they are not kept away or used responsibly, sensitively, and appropriately,
after repeated reminders. Once confiscated, these devices may be returned
to the student at a later time and the student would be deemed to have
committed an offence. In some instances, the school may require the presence
of a parent or guardian before the confiscated device is returned to the
student.</p>
<p><strong>11. Classroom Conduct</strong>
</p>
<p>11.1 The tone of the learning environment is vital to good teaching and
learning. The G.R.A.C.E Protocol is used to ensure that Bedok Viewans are
ready and prepared for every lesson.</p>
