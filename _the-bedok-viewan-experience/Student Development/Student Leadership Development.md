## Overview

The Bedok View (BV)&nbsp;Student Leadership Programme aims to equip Bedok Viewans with the leadership skills and competencies that prepare them to be future-ready in a constantly changing and volatile global landscape. This is underpinned by the BV Leadership Philosophy that every Bedok Viewan can be a leader and one who can make a difference.

**1 \. Three Domains of the BV Student Leadership Programme**

The intended outcome for the BV Student Leadership Programme is to nurture leaders who are grounded in Character and equipped with the Competencies to be Changemakers.&nbsp;This is summarised in the three domains of Character, Competency and Service.

At the core of every student leader is the domain of Character, which aims to instill sound values so that Bedok Viewans exhibit positive role-modelling and make responsible decisions.

The domain of Competency develops in students self-awareness and self-management skills to achieve personal effectiveness. They will also develop social awareness and interpersonal skills to influence their peers positively and lead confidently. Through the leadership training, students will learn the essential functional skills required of leaders such as to plan and manage projects, communicate clearly, and facilitate effectively.

The domain of Service focuses on students as active contributors by providing opportunities to create a more vibrant and positive school experience. They will learn to proactively identify problems and resolve it, acting as agents of change in their school and community.

**2 \. Approach to Leadership Development in Bedok View**

As students progress in their leadership journey, they will be endowed with greater responsibilities and nurtured into confident changemakers through a variety of platforms and opportunities to lead. The school leverages on&nbsp;the Learning for Life Programme framework in its approach to leadership development.

The journey begins with the ‘Transmission phase’ as&nbsp;they develop an awareness and understanding of good values and leadership competencies through the Leadership Challenge Model, taught to all Bedok Viewans during lessons facilitated by student leaders.

&nbsp;Next is the ‘Transactional phase’ which involves students translating their learning into concrete actions. Here,&nbsp;they demonstrate an understanding of what sound values and leadership competencies mean through leadership workshops where they apply their skills and knowledge in facilitating and carrying out various school activities.&nbsp;

Lastly, the ‘Transformational phase’ is when students are empowered to come forward with initiatives and rally others towards a common goal. Here, they&nbsp;advocate a sense of agency anchored on good values and leadership competencies through opportunities to initiate and plan school events or mentorship of junior leaders.

The Learn-Act-Lead cycle is a reinforcement loop for leadership development.

As espoused in our school’s vision to be ‘learners who learn for life and leaders who light the way’, our BV Student Leadership programme hopes to&nbsp;develop exemplary and inspiring leaders, where&nbsp;Bedok Viewans are beacons of hope who act as a guiding light to illuminate the way for others to follow.
