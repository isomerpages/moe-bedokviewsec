### CCA Overview &amp; Highlights

<img src="/images/English_Drama_01.jpg" style="width:49%" align="left">
Bedok View Drama Club gives students the opportunity to develop confidence on stage. Through staging and acting, students ignite their imagination as they bring characters and scenarios to life. Students participate in activities such as script-writing, vocal delivery and body posturing to develop a flair for on-stage speaking, movement, and writing. There are ample opportunities for experiential learning in the various areas of dramaturgy. Through school-based performances, students are also able to put their skills and knowledge to the test. The Drama Club aims to develop students who are poised, bold and dynamic communicators and artists in the future.

In 2021, the Drama Club participated in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation, showcasing a moving and insightful piece that highlighted the importance of family connections and mental health in the times of safe distancing and technological estrangement. In 2022, the Drama Club embarked on two school-based performances that brought to life hot-button issues of racial harmony, empathy, and preserving traditions in the face of modernity. The dedication and excellence that each actor and crew member put in made the experience so unforgettable and fulfilling for all involved.
