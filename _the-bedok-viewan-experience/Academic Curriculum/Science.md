<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>At Bedok View Secondary, we are committed to nurturing scientifically
literate, inquisitive, and self-directed learners with a lifelong passion
for science.</p>
<p>We employ an Inquiry-Based Learning Approach, specifically the 5E Instructional
Model, to guide the teaching and learning of science at all levels. Students'
scientific knowledge and skills are cultivated through three core platforms:
Classroom-Based Learning, Laboratory-Based Learning, and Experiential Learning.
Our Experiential Learning platform, in particular, offers a holistic and
integrated approach to applied science education.</p>
<p>STEM education is seamlessly infused into our science curriculum, ensuring
that students develop critical and inventive thinking skills. Through this
comprehensive learning experience, we aim to prepare students for the challenges
of the future.</p>
<p>In Lower Secondary, we implement a holistic teaching system tailored to
the needs of students across G1, G2, and G3. At the Upper Secondary level,
we offer a diverse range of courses, including Pure Biology, Pure Chemistry,
Pure Physics, as well as Combined Science (Physics and Chemistry) and Combined
Science (Biology and Chemistry). Our department is dedicated to providing
equal learning opportunities for all students, ensuring they receive a
well-rounded and thorough science education.</p>

<h5><strong>1. Science Integrated Activities (Secondary 1 &amp; Secondary 2)</strong></h5>
<p>The science department uses context-based approaches in the teaching and
learning of secondary school science. This approach is enacted through
the Science Integrated Activities that are predominantly conducted at lower
secondary level. The integrated activities focus on the issue of Sustainable
Development that is very relevant in our life today.&nbsp;</p>

<h5><strong>2. Science Experiential Workshops (SEW)</strong></h5>
<p>SEW are designed to allow students to apply what they have learnt in the
classrooms to try and address global issues.Signature workshops conducted
for our students are on Food Sustainability and Harnessing the Sun. Students
apply what they have learnt from the concept of ecology and try to grow
their own greens in our in-house Greenhouses. They also have to be creative
in using recycled materials to produce a solar powered car.</p>

<h5><strong>3. Applied Learning Modules At Polytechnics (ApLM@Poly)</strong></h5>
<p>The Applied Learning Modules (ApLM) give our students the opportunity
to experience life in tertiary education in advance.</p>
<p>They will gain knowledge and skills through hands-on learning under the
guidance of lecturers from the various polytechnics. Through customized
workshops, field trips, group projects and interactions with industry practitioners,
students will get to explore the uniqueness of different careers over the
3-day ApLM programme.</p>

<h5><strong>3. Learning Journeys</strong></h5>
<p>Educational tour aboard OceanXplorer, the world’s most advanced research
and media vessel, expands our students’ understanding of the potential
of ocean exploration and science. OceanX has been at the forefront of marine
conservation efforts, achieving remarkable feats such as filming the elusive
giant squid in the deep. Based in New York, OceanX aims to “explore the
ocean and bring it back to the world,” providing a platform to drive marine
conservation efforts.</p>
