### Blended Learning

In this digital era, it is important for our students to be equipped with the necessary knowledge, skills and dispositions to thrive in an interconnected, diverse and rapidly-changing world.

Hence, Blended Learning will be a key feature of the schooling experience to further develop students' ability to be self-directed, passionate and life-long learners. Through Blended Learning, regularly scheduled HBL Days will complement teaching and learning in schools.
