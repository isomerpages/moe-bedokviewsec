<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Education is about looking beyond the child’s intellect and seeing the
whole child.</p>
<p>The Aesthetics subjects offer fundamental knowledge, skills and concepts
through real-world application. Students learn to integrate knowledge from
research, design solutions to problems, experiment, analyse and critique,
manage resources enterprisingly and work independently and in teams. They
learn to solve problems in situations where not all information is available,
thus helping them to cope with ambiguity.</p>
<p>The Aesthetics subjects allow students to perceive objects and their environment,
creatively express their feelings and emotions, broaden their minds and
nourish the soul.</p>
<p>These values and skills contribute to the holistic development of the
student as a person, which bodes well for him against a backdrop of fast-paced
change in the future.</p>
<p>We aim to providing a holistic education that integrates theoretical knowledge
with hands-on experiences. Our mission is to nurture well-rounded individuals
who are not only proficient in their respective fields but also possess
the ability to think creatively, solve problems effectively, and contribute
positively to society.</p>
<p><strong>Design &amp; Technology</strong>
</p>
<p>Design and Technology use uncertainty, ambiguity and ill-defined problems
as learning opportunities. Students apply the design thinking process to
create possible solutions that can improve their surroundings and the well-being
of individuals and the society.</p>
<p><strong>Nutrition &amp; Food Science</strong>
</p>
<p>At the lower secondary levels, the Food and Consumer Education (FCE) curriculum
equips students with information on nutrition, diet and basic money management
to prepare them to become discerning consumers and make sound decisions
and food choices in their everyday living. In-depth knowledge and skills
in this subject area such as principles of food science and concepts of
diet, meal-planning, health and nutrition are taught in the Nutrition &amp;
Food Science (NFS) curriculum at the upper secondary levels.</p>
<p><strong>Art</strong>
</p>
<p>In the learning of Art, students are provided with opportunities to explore
and experiment with a range of media, engage in discussions about artwork
and develop understanding and application of visual qualities such as Elements
of Art (EOA) and Principles of Design (POD). Students learn to understand
the context in which art is created through the study of artworks and artists.
This provides them with a deeper understanding of the art processes and
how these are relevant in the creation of their own artwork. Students’
artworks, displayed in the Aesthetics Gallery in Bedok View, and learning
journeys to museum exhibitions allow students to experience art beyond
the classroom.</p>
<p><strong>Music</strong>
</p>
<p>The music curriculum develops students’ musical ability through listening,
performing and composing activities. A range of music styles are introduced
to students to grow their appreciation for different cultures and time
periods. Students develop listening and performing skills through learning
and playing instruments such as, ukulele, guitar, keyboard and percussion
instruments. Song writing and arrangement using music technology provide
opportunities for students to create and collaborate.</p>
