### Overview

Education is about looking beyond the child’s intellect and seeing the whole child. 


The Aesthetics subjects offer fundamental knowledge, skills and concepts through real-world application. Students learn to integrate knowledge from research, design solutions to problems, experiment, analyse and critique, manage resources enterprisingly and work independently and in teams. They learn to solve problems in situations where not all information is available, thus helping them to cope with ambiguity. 

The Aesthetics subjects allow students to perceive objects and their environment, creatively express their feelings and emotions, broaden their minds and nourish the soul. 


These values and skills contribute to the holistic development of the student as a person, which bodes well for him against a backdrop of fast-paced change in the future.


**Design &amp; Technology**

Design and Technology use uncertainty, ambiguity and ill-defined problems as learning opportunities. Students apply the design thinking process to create possible solutions that can improve their surroundings and the well-being of individuals and the society.


**Nutrition &amp; Food Science**

At the lower secondary levels, the Food and Consumer Education (FCE) curriculum equips students with information on nutrition, diet and basic money management to prepare them to become discerning consumers and make sound decisions and food choices in their everyday living. In-depth knowledge and skills in this subject area such as principles of food science and concepts of diet, meal-planning, health and nutrition are taught in the Nutrition &amp; Food Science (NFS) curriculum at the upper secondary levels.


**Art**

In the learning of Art, students are provided with opportunities to explore and experiment with a range of media, engage in discussions about artwork and develop understanding and application of visual qualities such as Elements of Art (EOA) and Principles of Design (POD). 
Students learn to understand the context in which art is created through the study of artworks and artists. This provides them with a deeper understanding of the art processes and how these are relevant in the creation of their own artwork.
Students’ artworks, displayed in the Aesthetics Gallery in Bedok View, and learning journeys to museum exhibitions allow students to experience art beyond the classroom.


**Music**

The music curriculum develops students’ musical ability through listening, performing and composing activities. A range of music styles are introduced to students to grow their appreciation for different cultures and time periods. Students develop listening and performing skills through learning and playing instruments such as, ukulele, guitar, keyboard and percussion instruments. Song writing and arrangement using music technology provide opportunities for students to create and collaborate.
