<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The Mathematics Department in Bedok View Secondary School (BVSS) adopts
a two-prong approach to deliver our curriculum to cater to the learning
needs of our students, primarily to strengthen the foundation for the masses,
and to enhance the competency in numeracy for those with a keen interest
to pursue Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education
and career.</p>
<p>The overarching goal of the national Mathematics curriculum is to ensure
that all students will achieve a level of mastery of Mathematics to serve
them well in life, and for those who have the interest and ability, to
learn mathematics at the highest possible level.</p>
<h3>Programmes</h3>
<p>The Mathematics Department seeks to develop our students into analytical
and logical thinkers with problem solving skills for application in the
real-world context. The department has endeavoured to enhance the quality
of students’ learning through our curriculum within and beyond the classroom
as we believe that inherent in every child, there is a potential to be
developed, when given the right stimulus, nurturing, and platforms for
exposure. In 2025, selected students across lower and upper secondary levels
were given the opportunity to participate in the Singapore Mathematical
Olympiad.</p>
<p>The table below summarises our students’ achievements for this year.</p>
