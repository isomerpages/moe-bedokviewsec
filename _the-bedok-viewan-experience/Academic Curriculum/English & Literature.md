<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The English and Literature department believes in strengthening the language
education of students by nurturing in them a deep understanding of language
and literacy, the value of critical reading and effecting writing, and
the richness of literature. We seek to foster knowledge of current affairs
and develop a love of literature and of language in our students. To this
end, we will provide students with a rich and dynamic curriculum which
can engage them and develop them to be confident and skilled communicators.</p>
<h3>Programmes</h3>
<p><strong>Dream Big Project</strong>
</p>
<p>Through this three-month programme, all Secondary 1 students have the
opportunity to work in groups to perform a skit. Under the tutelage of
their EL teachers, they write their own script and put into practice public
speaking skills by presenting their skit to their classmates.</p>

<p><strong>Debates</strong>
</p>
<p>As part of the Secondary 3 EL programme, the students learn how to speak
in front of an audience and carry out a formal debate. They learn the techniques
and strategies to present their arguments persuasively and confidently.
At the same time, they develop critical thinking skills while discussing
points regarding various global and local issues.</p>
