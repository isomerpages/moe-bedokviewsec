### Overview

The English and Literature department believes in strengthening the language education of students by nurturing in them a deep understanding of language and literacy, the value of critical reading and effecting writing, and the richness of literature. We seek to foster knowledge of current affairs and develop a love of literature and of language in our students. To this end, we will provide students with a rich and dynamic curriculum which can engage them and develop them to be confident and skilled communicators.

### Programmes

**Dream Big Project**

Through this four-month programme, all Secondary 1 students have the opportunity to work in groups to perform a skit. Under the tutelage of their EL teachers, they write their own script and put into practice public speaking skills by presenting their skit to their classmates.

**Debates**

As part of the Secondary 3 EL programme, the students learn how to speak in front of an
audience and carry out a formal debate. They learn the techniques to speak to an audience
persuasively and confidently as they develop critical thinking discussing points regarding
various global and local issues.
