<h3>Background</h3>
<p>1 . The National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) was launched in March
2020 to make digital learning inclusive by equipping students with the
digital literacies to be future-ready.</p>
<p>2 . Under the NDLP, MOE announced in 2020 that every student will own
a school-prescribed personal learning device (PLD) by end-2021. Singapore
Citizen students can use their Edusave Account to pay for the PLD.</p>
<p>3 . The use of the personal learning devices for teaching and learning
will</p><pre><code>  1) support the development of digital literacies in our students,
  2) support self-directed and collaborative learning, and
  3) enhance teaching and learning</code></pre>

<p><strong>6 . Frequently Asked Questions</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>I. How do I check my child’s edusave balance? How much do I have to pay?</strong>
</p>
<p>Parents may call this number 6260 0777 to check the edusave balance.</p>
<p>All Singaporean students are supported by MOE in purchasing a device.
They can tap on their Edusave Account to reduce their out-of-pocket (OOP)
expenses when buying a device.</p>
<p>For students from lower-income households, MOE will provide further subsidies
so that they do not have to incur any OOP expenses. Students may approach
their schools if they require financial assistance.</p>
<p>Permanent residents (PR) and international students (IS) who need support
could apply for subsidies, particularly those whose Gross Household Income
(GHI) is below $4000 or Per Capita Income (PCI)# is below $1000. For more
details, please approach the school</p>
<p><strong>II. What happens if the device is stolen/lost? Does the contract include insurance? If so, what is covered under the insurance</strong>
</p>
<p>The insurance covers the following:</p>

<p><strong>III.&nbsp;What happens if the child’s device is down or need repairs?</strong>
</p>
<p>Technical support will be provided to students through:
<br>– Service desk set up in school during breaks and after school on a weekly
basis
<br>– Collection of devices to be sent for repairs
<br>– Lenovo Service Centre at Tai Seng Centre, SmartCares Solutions (3 Irving
Road, #01-17 Singapore 369522)</p>
<p>School will have a pool of devices for students to loan&nbsp;for use in
the mean time</p>
<p><strong>IV. What if I prefer for my child/ward to use his/her own personal computing device (“device”) in school?</strong>
</p>
<p>You will need to bring your device for assessment of the following:
<br>– device should not be older than 4 years from manufacturing date;
<br>– battery should hold charge for at least 4 hours;
<br>– comparable form factor to school’s bulk tender devices (e.g. touchscreen,
physical keyboard);
<br>– comparable features to school’s bulk tender devices (e.g. inking if
school
<br>programme requires students to use free hand writing or sketching);
<br>– comparable performance to school’s bulk tender devices</p>
<p>Do note a&nbsp;<strong>factory reset of your device may be required</strong>&nbsp;for
installation of the Device Management Application, which is compulsory
for all students' learning devices.</p>
