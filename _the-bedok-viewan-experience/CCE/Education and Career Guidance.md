<p>Education and Career Guidance (ECG) is about <strong>equipping</strong> students
with the necessary <strong>knowledge</strong>, <strong>skills</strong> and <strong>values</strong> to
make <strong>informed decisions</strong> at each key education stage for
successful transition from school to further education or work in order
to manage their career pathways and lifelong learning throughout their
lives.</p>
<p>The comprehensive ECG curriculum in Bedok View is illustrated in the framework.
The key focus is to <strong>Help Students Realise Their Dream</strong> with
the 4 supportive structures to ensure good implementation of the total
curriculum for ECG. This is in line with ECG practices in comprehensive
guidance programmes , where ECG is delivered through the 4 pillars of a <strong>robust ECG curriculum, competent ECG personnel, quality ECG counselling</strong> and <strong>supportive partners</strong>.</p>
<p>Our school's approach to ECG is guided by the ECG Developmental Model
where we programme developmentally appropriate ECG activities for students
at different levels. It is a process that takes place in the lives of our
students and has a positive impact on the quality of their educational
and career decisions, and also on their education performance and the overall
climate of the school. There are 3 different emphasis at the different
levels to meet varying developmental needs:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>ENGAGE</strong>: How do I get there? (Awareness)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>EQUIP</strong>: Where do I want to go? (Exploration)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>EXPLORE</strong>: Who am I? (Clarification)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Bedok Viewans will be nurtured and developed with the competencies, imbibed
with the values and necessary skills to keep learning, to be adaptable
and to be resilient in their personal pursuits and career developments.</p>
