Education and Career Guidance (ECG) is about **equipping** students with the necessary **knowledge**, **skills** and **values** to make **informed decisions** at each key education stage for successful transition from school to further education or work in order to manage their career pathways and lifelong learning throughout their lives.

The comprehensive ECG curriculum in Bedok View is illustrated in the framework. The key focus is to **Help Students Realise Their Dream** with the 4 supportive structures to ensure good implementation of the total curriculum for ECG. This is in line with ECG practices in comprehensive guidance programmes , where ECG is delivered through the 4 pillars of a **robust ECG curriculum, competent ECG personnel, quality ECG counselling** and **supportive partners**. 

Our school's approach to ECG is guided by the ECG Developmental Model where we programme developmentally appropriate ECG activities for students at different levels. It is a process that takes place in the lives of our students and has a positive impact on the quality of their educational and career decisions, and also on their education performance and the overall climate of the school. There are 3 different emphasis at the different levels to meet varying developmental needs:

1.	**ENGAGE**: How do I get there? (Awareness)
2.	**EQUIP**: Where do I want to go? (Exploration)
3.	**EXPLORE**: Who am I? (Clarification)

Bedok Viewans will be nurtured and developed with the competencies, imbibed with the values and necessary skills to keep learning, to be adaptable and to be resilient in their personal pursuits and career developments.
