<p>National Education (NE) aims to provide our students with the knowledge,
skills, and values to understand Singapore’s history and unique geo-political
context, appreciate our journey to nationhood, cultivate the instincts
for survival as a nation, and have confidence in our nation’s future.</p>
<p>Considering the current local and global context, it is recognised that
NE has to be empowering and aspirational, allowing for individual sense-making
so as to nurture active and engaged citizens, who are socially aware, skilled
in critical thinking, and informed about local, regional and global issues.</p>
<p>The following key dispositions for citizenship in Singapore shape our
purpose and approach to NE:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>A Sense of Belonging</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A Sense of Reality</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A Sense of Hope</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A Will to Act</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In Bedok View, NE is championed by a group of student leaders known as
the <strong>Red Dot Ambassadors</strong>. They lead the commemoration of
the four National Education events, namely:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Total Defence Day</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>International Friendship Day</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Racial Harmony Day and</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>National Day</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Red Dot Ambassadors (RDAs) represent an interest group of students
who play a critical role in organizing and promoting National Education
(NE) related activities within &amp; beyond the school. They do this through
small initiatives as well as through the execution of core events in the
school. Besides this, the RDAs also play an important role in the integration
of the International Students (IS).</p>
<p><strong>Key Roles of Red Dot Ambassadors (RDAs)</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To promote National Education and support the school through the 4 core
NE events &amp; other enrichment programmes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To support the integration of the International Students.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Training Opportunities</strong>
</p>
<p>To engage students in an experiential manner, NE learning journeys to
various venues such as museums are conducted. In this way, we provide opportunities
for Bedok Viewans to explore and examine their identity as Singaporeans
and arrive at a common set of ideals and values.</p>
