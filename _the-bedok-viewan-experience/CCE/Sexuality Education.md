<h3>Sexuality Education</h3>
<p>Sexuality Education is the teaching of facts and values pertaining to
human sexuality. It aims to help students understand their gender role
and how they relate to others in society. Sexuality Education covers four
dimensions which shape a personâ€™s sexuality: the <strong>Physical, Emotional, Social and Ethical</strong> dimensions.
Sexuality Education is conducted through structured lessons, workshops
and Assembly programmes.</p>
