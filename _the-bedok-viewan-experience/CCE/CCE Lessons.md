<h3>Character &amp; Citizenship Education Lessons</h3>
<p>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is at the heart of education
in Singapore. Through CCE, students learn values, social-emotional competencies,
and develop character and citizenship dispositions that enable them to
grow holistically and learn for life.</p>
<p>We aim to accomplish these goals through the implementation of the CCE
2021 curriculum.</p>
