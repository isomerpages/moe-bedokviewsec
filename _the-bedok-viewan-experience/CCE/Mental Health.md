Students will be explicitly taught:

* how to maintain their well-being,
* better understand common mental health problems and their symptoms,
* recognise signs of mental distress,
* know when and how to seek help and support, and
* develop empathy and care towards people with mental illness.

Students will develop critical social-emotional skills such as emotion regulation, self-control, coping, problem-solving, seeking help and goal-setting. They will also learn to maintain healthy lifestyle habits and better see setbacks as opportunities to learn and grow.
