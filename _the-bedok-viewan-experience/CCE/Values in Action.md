The Values in Action (VIA) programme is an integral part of the holistic education which every Bedok Viewan receives. It is an example of a **key Student Development Experience (SDE)** and forms an important component of Character &amp; Citizenship Education, where opportunities are provided for moral actions. The VIA programme in Bedok View adopts the **Head, Heart, Hand** approach which is central to this framework: 

(i)	**Head**: Bedok Viewans learn to think critically about issues and arrive at a deeper understanding of the challenges facing Singapore. <br>
(ii)	**Heart**: Bedok Viewans learn to empathise with the needs of others and have a deeper sense of compassion. <br>
(iii)	**Hand**: Bedok Viewans learn to give back to society in various ways, and are empowered to contribute, create and lead a better, values-driven society in Singapore.

Bedok Viewans contribute to the society in various ways: 

(i)	**Action**: By taking action to improve a situation they care about, <br>
(ii)	**Awareness**: By promoting awareness so that others may learn about an important issue/ concern in the community, and<br>
(iii)	**Advocacy**: By being an advocate to inspire and influence others to make a difference to something that they care about.

As for the stages of planning and implementation of the VIA projects, Bedok Viewans adopt the RRR process: 

(i)	**Ready**: Project Planning &amp; Preparation where students identify their learning goals and needs of the community, <br>
(ii)	**Render**: Project Implementation where students undergo conscious learning and execute their projects, and <br>
(iii)	**Reflect**: Post-Project Reflection where students think about how they can improve and reinforce their learning.

The VIA programme supports studentsâ€™ development as socially responsible students who contribute meaningfully to the community, through the learning and application of knowledge, skills and values. With values-driven co-curricular programmes in place, Bedok Viewans participate actively in meaningful VIA projects organised by the school or initiated by the class/ CCA/ individuals. The scope of projects for the programme is wide and varied, ranging from VIA projects carried out within the school to those conserving the environment, serving the community as well as the nation.

In conclusion, this framework illuminates the path for Bedok Viewans to learn the value of giving back to society, while acquiring values and the 21st century competencies: a confident person, self-directed learner, concerned citizen and active contributor.

###### Community Youth Leadership in BV

We also provide opportunities for students to contribute meaningfully to the community by engaging various community stakeholders.

We have a sustained partnership with APSN Katong in the programme BV Connects. Our Bedok Viewans befriend students from APSN and this provides the opportunity for them to learn the importance of social integration and inclusivity. BV also partners South East Community Development Council in several initiatives such as the Community Laboratory Project.

In the annual BV Values In Action Marketplace, voluntary welfare organisations (VWO) share with students their missions, beneficiary profiles and needs. Through open conversations and sharing, students develop greater awareness about the needy and underprivileged as well as connect with VWOs they are keen to carry out meaningful VIA projects with. In meeting the needs of the Bedok community, Bedok Viewans learn the importance of the value of Service.
