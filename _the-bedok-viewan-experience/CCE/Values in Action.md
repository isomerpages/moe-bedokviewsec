<p>The Values in Action (VIA) programme is an integral part of the holistic
education which every Bedok Viewan receives. It is an example of a <strong>key Student Development Experience (SDE)</strong> and
forms an important component of Character &amp; Citizenship Education,
where opportunities are provided for moral actions. The VIA programme in
Bedok View adopts the <strong>Head, Heart, Hand</strong> approach which is
central to this framework:</p>
<p>(i) <strong>Head</strong>: Bedok Viewans learn to think critically about
issues and arrive at a deeper understanding of the challenges facing Singapore.
<br>(ii) <strong>Heart</strong>: Bedok Viewans learn to empathise with the
needs of others and have a deeper sense of compassion.
<br>(iii) <strong>Hand</strong>: Bedok Viewans learn to give back to society
in various ways, and are empowered to contribute, create and lead a better,
values-driven society in Singapore.</p>
<p>Bedok Viewans contribute to the society in various ways:</p>
<p>(i) <strong>Action</strong>: By taking action to improve a situation they
care about,
<br>(ii) <strong>Awareness</strong>: By promoting awareness so that others
may learn about an important issue/ concern in the community, and
<br>(iii) <strong>Advocacy</strong>: By being an advocate to inspire and influence
others to make a difference to something that they care about.</p>
<p>As for the stages of planning and implementation of the VIA projects,
Bedok Viewans adopt the RRR process:</p>
<p>(i) <strong>Ready</strong>: Project Planning &amp; Preparation where students
identify their learning goals and needs of the community,
<br>(ii) <strong>Render</strong>: Project Implementation where students undergo
conscious learning and execute their projects, and
<br>(iii) <strong>Reflect</strong>: Post-Project Reflection where students
think about how they can improve and reinforce their learning.</p>
<p>The VIA programme supports studentsâ€™ development as socially responsible
students who contribute meaningfully to the community, through the learning
and application of knowledge, skills and values. With values-driven co-curricular
programmes in place, Bedok Viewans participate actively in meaningful VIA
projects organised by the school or initiated by the class/ CCA/ individuals.
The scope of projects for the programme is wide and varied, ranging from
VIA projects carried out within the school to those conserving the environment,
serving the community as well as the nation.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this framework illuminates the path for Bedok Viewans to
learn the value of giving back to society, while acquiring values and the
21st century competencies: a confident person, self-directed learner, concerned
citizen and active contributor.</p>

<p>We also provide opportunities for students to contribute meaningfully
to the community by engaging various community stakeholders.</p>
<p>We have a sustained partnership with APSN Katong in the programme BV Connects.
Our Bedok Viewans befriend students from APSN and this provides the opportunity
for them to learn the importance of social integration and inclusivity.
On top of that, BV also partners Siglap Hearty Meals, an initiative by
Siglap CC where needy residents in the Siglap community are being cared
for.</p>
<p>In the annual BV Values In Action Marketplace, voluntary welfare organisations
(VWO) share with students their missions, beneficiary profiles and needs.
Through open conversations and sharing, students develop greater awareness
about the needy and underprivileged as well as connect with VWOs they are
keen to carry out meaningful VIA projects with. In meeting the needs of
the Bedok community, Bedok Viewans learn the importance of the value of
Service.</p>
