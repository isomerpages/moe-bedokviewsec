<h3>Overview</h3>
<p><strong>Objectives of Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The desired outcomes of the Good Value @ BV are to engender positive attitudes
and character traits in Bedok View students through a structured provision
of opportunities. Students apply values learned in two areas: the CCE and
CCA curriculum.</p>
<p>Specific outcomes would be observable demonstration by BV students of
school and CCE values. Authentic experiences, aligned to CCE learning outcomes
and values, are provided through suitable opportunities during PE lessons,
CCA sessions and VIA projects in collaboration with different external
partners. Students will understand the extent to which they have exemplified
positive values and learn how to live out these values.</p>
<h3>Programmes</h3>
<p>The programme will consist of two tiers. A tiered approach serves to provide
different depths of experience. Students from the CCA will be expected
to demonstrate an additional level of competency on top of what is expected
for the whole school population.</p>
<p><strong>Tier 1 Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>In Tier 1, all students will apply selected values / learning points from
their CCE lessons using various platforms. The LLP will be differentiated
and progressive through the levels by focusing on the following approaches.</p>

<p><strong>LEARN</strong> 
<br>The approach refers to the lessons in the curriculum and co-curriculum
which seeks to create awareness and understanding of BV / CCE values.</p>
<p><strong>ACT</strong> 
<br>The approach relates to how students demonstrate their understanding of
the BV / CCE values in various situations.</p>
<p><strong>LEAD</strong> 
<br>The approach means that students will be able to go beyond personal demonstration
of the BV / CCE values to using the same values to lead others.</p>
<p><strong>Tier 2 Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>In Tier 2, the target group is the Upper Secondary students and the focus
is specifically on values related to student leadership and the approach
utilised is mainly the LEAD approach. However, adoption of the approach
in this tier goes beyond guiding others in applying only BV / CCE values.
It also involves imparting and reinforcing specific leadership values to
their juniors. The additional emphasis on leadership traits stems from
the primary goal of CCA to develop all CCA members as student leaders.</p>
<p><strong>Value-add of Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The Good Value @ BV programme aims to complement the other Student Development
Experiences. In particular, it addresses two aspects. First, it will deliberately
provide opportunities for students to apply what they learn about values,
which would otherwise be missed out due to lack of attention to these opportunities.
Second, it will touch the heart, i.e. internalising the values. This second
aspect will require teachers to be able to facilitate the reflection and
learning when students carry out the programme activities.</p>
