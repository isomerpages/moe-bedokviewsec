Through Cyber Wellness education, students learn to be **respectful**, **safe** and **responsible** users of technology. They also learn to be a **positive peer influence**, advocating for the good of the community online. These are our **Cyber Wellness Student Ambassadors**.  

Students will understand three important key messages: 
(a) Embrace the affordances of technology while maintaining a **balanced lifestyle** between offline and online activities <br>
(b) Be a safe and responsible user of technology and maintain a **positive online presence** <br>
(c) Be **responsible for personal well-being** in the cyber-space.

CCE offers an important platform for achieving Cyber Wellness outcomes. The CCE module on Cyber Wellness will provide systematic instruction to facilitate the development of life-long social-emotional competencies which are grounded on sound values, so that our students would be poised to harness the power of ICT and avoid its danger so as to benefit themselves and the community.
