### Overview

**BV Character & Citizenship Education Framework**

**Character & Citizenship** is central to Bedok View’s vision of developing Learners who Learn for Life, Leaders who Light The Way. School leaders and staff work in synergy to realise the school mission to **\`Nurture Bedok Viewans who Aspire, Strive and Dare as Learners and Leaders.** The CCE framework (based on MOE’s CCE 2021 Curriculum Frame) draws together the different aspects of CCE in providing a student-centric, values-driven education.

**The Lighthouse & Our 2RISE Values:**

The product of a successful CCE curriculum in Bedok View is illustrated in the centre of the diagram above. As a source of light, we hope this Character & Citizenship Framework will guide us all - hence, the ‘lighthouse’ is central in this framework. The school’s values **2RISE - Respect, Responsibility, Integrity, Service and Excellence** are housed in the rays emanating from the school symbol of the lighthouse. These values will guide the school in developing our students’ character, providing a solid foundation for the students to withstand the waves of changes and challenges brought about by a rapidly changing world. The student’s actions are guided by these values as demonstrated by the rays emitted by the lighthouse.

**Goals of CCE:**

With CCE 2021, we aim to develop in our students: Good Character, Resilience and Social-Emotional Well-Being, Future Readiness and Active Citizenship.

**a. Good character:** Have a sound moral compass and a strong sense of right and wrong, think critically and ethically, be discerning in judgment, take responsibility for choices and actions, be caring towards others and strive for excellence;

**b. Resilience and social-emotional well-being:** Have a balanced sense of self, form healthy relationships, be resilient when faced with challenges, find meaning in life, and have a sense of gratitude and appreciation;

**c. Future readiness:** Have a sense of purpose in life, develop the dispositions of adaptability and lifelong learning so as to be able to navigate education and career pathways purposefully and take on the challenges of the future, including the world of work and life; and  

**d. Active citizenship:** Develop a strong national identity based on a sense of belonging to the nation, a sense of hope in themselves and the future, an awareness of the reality of Singapore’s vulnerabilities and constraints, and the will to act on improving the lives of others, and building a future for our nation.

The CCE 2021 Curriculum Content is based on the three big ideas of **Identity**, **Relationships** and **Choices**. It involves the teaching and learning of core values and social-emotional competencies with a focus of developing a sense of purpose in our students. These fundamentals are taught and applied in the six curriculum content areas of CCE - **National Education, Sexuality Education, Mental Health, Education & Career Guidance, Cyber Wellness and  Family Education.**

The CCE 2021 Curriculum is enacted intentionally through learning platforms such as CCE Lessons, key Student Development Experiences (SDEs) such as Values in Action, school-based initiatives, other subjects, and opportunities for personal application.

At Bedok View, we provide a caring and enabling school environment. It is one that provides adult role modelling, positive teacher-student relationships, peer support and relationships, student voice and ownership, and consistent and coherent messaging on CCE.

We are certain that with all these, every Bedok Viewan will grow up to be a Responsible, Global Citizen with Exemplary Character, as mentioned in the lighthouse.
