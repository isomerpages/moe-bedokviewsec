**BV Character & Citizenship Education Framework**

Character & Citizenship is central to Bedok View’s vision of creating a **'School of High Standards, Quality Learning and Holistic Development’.** School leaders and staff work in synergy to realise the school mission to **'Nurture Students, Transform Lives and Serve the Nation**’. The CCE framework (based on MOE’s CCE 2021 Curriculum Frame) draws together the different aspects of CCE in providing a student-centric, values-driven education.

**The Lighthouse & Our 2RISE Values:** 

The product of a successful CCE curriculum in Bedok View is illustrated in the centre of the diagram above. As a source of light and power, we hope this Character & Citizenship Framework will guide us all- hence, the ‘lighthouse’ is central in this framework. The school’s values **2RISE - Respect, Responsibility, Integrity, Service and Excellence** are housed in the rays emanating from the school symbol of the lighthouse as these will guide the school in developing our students’ character, provide a solid foundation for the students to withstand the waves of changes and challenges brought about by a rapidly changing world. 

**21st Century Competencies:**


The student’s actions are guided by these values and are manifested in the form of the 21st Century Competencies of **a confident person, self-directed learner, concerned citizen and active contributor**, as demonstrated by the rays emitted by the lighthouse.

A **confident person** who has a strong sense of right and wrong, is adaptable and resilient, knows himself, is discerning in judgment, thinks independently and critically, and communicates effectively,

A **self-directed learner** who questions, reflects, perseveres and takes responsibility for his own learning, An **active contributor** who is able to work effectively in teams, is innovative, exercises initiative, takes calculated risks and strives for excellence. Last but not least, he is

A **concerned citizen** who is rooted to Singapore, has a strong sense of civic responsibility, is informed about Singapore and the world, and takes an active part in bettering the lives of others around him.

A.    **The CCE Curriculum Content** is based on the three big ideas of Identity, Relationships and Choices. It comprises the learning of core values, social and emotional competencies, and citizenship dispositions, with a focus of developing a sense of purpose in our students. It includes the following: **National Education, Sexuality Education, Mental Health, Education and Career Guidance, Cyber Wellness and  Family Education**.

B.    **Enactment of CCE Curriculum**: This occurs intentionally through learning platforms such as CCE Lessons, key **Student Development Experiences (SDEs)** such as Values in Action, school-based initiatives, other subjects and opportunities for personal application.

C.    **Caring and Enabling School Environment**: A school environment that enables effective CCE includes adult role-modelling, positive teacher-student relationships, peer support and relationships (e.g. Peer Support Programme, Class Spirit Award), student voice and ownership and consistent and coherent messaging on CCE.  There are also ample platforms to develop supportive relationships in the classrooms through regular, structured sessions for students to speak, listen, interact and share concerns e.g. FT Periods, Class Meetings, Circle Time.

We are certain that with all this, every Bedok Viewan will grow to be a **Responsible, Global Citizen with Exemplary Character**, as mentioned in the lighthouse.
