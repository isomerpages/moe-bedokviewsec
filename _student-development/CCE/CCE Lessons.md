### Character & Citizenship Education Lessons

Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is at the heart of education in Singapore. Through CCE, students learn values, social-emotional competencies, and develop character and citizenship dispositions that enable them to grow holistically and learn for life.
We aim to accomplish these goals through the implementation of the CCE 2021 curriculum.

o   Good Character – Bedok Viewans will have a sound moral compass, a strong sense of right and wrong, be caring towards others and strive for excellence. <br>

o   Resilience and Social Emotional Well-Being – Bedok Viewans will have a balanced sense of self, be resilient when faced with challenges, find meaning in life, and have a sense of gratitude and appreciation. <br> 

o   Active Citizenship – Bedok Viewans will develop a sense of belonging to the nation, and the will to act on improving the lives of others and building a future for our nation. <br>

o   Future Readiness – Bedok Viewans will have a sense of purpose in life, and to develop the dispositions of adaptability and lifelong learning.

The CCE committee plans the CCE curriculum for the school and supports all teachers to ensure CCE is carried out effectively in the classrooms.

The themes for the CCE lessons include the following:

o   Becoming My Best Self <br>
o   Building Connections <br>
o   Making Choices
