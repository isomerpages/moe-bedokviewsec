National Education (NE) aims to provide our students with the knowledge, skills, and values to understand Singapore’s history and unique geo-political context, appreciate our journey to nationhood, cultivate the instincts for survival as a nation, and have confidence in our nation’s future.  

Considering the current local and global context, it is recognised that NE has to be empowering and aspirational, allowing for individual sense-making so as to nurture active and engaged citizens, who are socially aware, skilled in critical thinking, and informed about local, regional and global issues.

The following key dispositions for citizenship in Singapore shape our purpose and approach to NE:

* **A Sense of Belonging**
* **A Sense of Reality**
* **A Sense of Hope**
* **A Will to Act**

In Bedok View, NE is championed by a group of student leaders known as the **Red Dot Ambassadors**. They lead the commemoration of the four National Education events such as:

* **Total Defence Day**
* **International Friendship Day**
* **Racial Harmony Day and**
* **National Day**

The Red Dot Ambassadors (RDAs) represent an interest group of students who play a critical role in organizing and promoting National Education (NE) related activities within &amp; beyond the school. They do this through small initiatives as well as through the execution of core events in the school. Besides this, the RDAs also play an important role in the integration of the International Students (IS).

**Key Roles of Red Dot Ambassadors (RDAs)**

*   To promote National Education in school through the 4 core events &amp; other enrichment programmes
*   To support the school in the 4 core events &amp; other enrichment programmes
*   To support the integration of the International Students.

**Training Opportunities**

To engage students in an experiential manner, NE learning journeys to various venues such as museums are conducted. In this way, we provide opportunities for Bedok Viewans to explore and examine their identity as Singaporeans and arrive at a common set of ideals and values.

Bedok View Secondary School commemorates Total Defence Day annually by conducting a series of activities to our students of different levels on the importance of Total Defence to the nation which included:

* Inviting military officers through the **Commitment to Defence (C2D) Ambassadors Programme and Schools-NEXUS Partnership programme** to engage Secondary 4 and 5 students on National Defence topics.
* Designing a lesson package which tapped on the **Straits Times (IN Edition)** to educate Secondary 2 and 3 students on the sixth pillar of Total Defence, Cyber Defence.
* Conducting **First-Aid Bandaging activity** to educate Secondary 1 students on the importance of being equipped with life-saving skills in cases of emergency
* Assigning students to set up booth during recess times to share information and enhance their peers’ understanding on the pillars of Total Defence.

 The school commemorated **SAF Day** by encouraging their NSman employees to don uniforms and recite the SAF pledge during the morning assembly.  The school also conducted the annual National Day observance ceremony by having the marching-in of uniform group cadets during Flag-Raising to commemorate Singapore’s independence.
