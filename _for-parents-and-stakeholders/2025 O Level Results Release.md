<p>Dear Parents/Guardians and Class of 2025,</p>
<p>The 2025 O-Level results will be released on 14 January 2026. While we
await the results, let us also remember to celebrate our Bedok Viewans'
efforts, regardless of the results. We can show support by showing them
through our words and actions that their grades do not define who they
are.</p>
<p><u>Resources for Parents</u>
</p>
<p>For resources on social and emotional support as well as education and
career guidance, please refer to the <a href="/files/2025_O_Level_Parent_Information_Sheet.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Information Sheet for Parents</a>,

<p><u>ECG Counselling Support</u>
</p>
<p>For ECG counselling support, students may contact the ECG Counsellor in
their schools or make an ECG counselling appointment with the ECG Centre
@ MOE from 7 - 21 January 2026 (Weekdays: 9.00 am to 5.00 pm; Saturdays:
9.00 am to 12.00 pm) through the <a href="https://go.gov.sg/moe-ecg-centre" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">appointment booking form</a>.</p>
<p><u>Collection of GCE O-Level Results</u>
</p>
<p>All students are to return to their Secondary schools to collect their
results. Those who are unable to collect their results in person can appoint
a proxy to collect a physical copy of their results from the school. Proxies
are required to produce the relevant documents for the school’s verification
when collecting the results.</p>
<p>Students may start reporting from 1.30pm and be seated in the hall by
1.55pm.</p>
