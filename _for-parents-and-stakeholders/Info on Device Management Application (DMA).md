<p>Dear Parent,
<br>
<br>All devices used for the PLD Initiative (i.e., PLDs and student-owned
devices used in lieu of a PLD) will be installed with a Device Management
Application (DMA). As part of the DMA, parents are also provided with three
After-School DMA Parent Options. These options provide you with the flexibility
in managing your child’s/ward’s use of the PLD after school.</p>
<p>The DMA only collects information required to facilitate an environment
conducive to teaching and learning, and to encourage good online practices.
Please refer to <strong>Annexes A-C</strong> for more information about the
DMA. You may also refer to the links to the Parent User Guides for more
details on the different After-School DMA Parent Options.</p>

<p>Please indicate your choice via the FormSG link: <a href="https://go.gov.sg/bv-dma-option" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://go.gov.sg/bv-dma-option</a>.
These changes will only take effect within 2 weeks. If you do not indicate
a choice, the Default option will be applied.</p>

<h4>After- School DMA Settings</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

<p><strong>Default Option:</strong> In-school hours settings to continue after
school hours</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Option A:</strong> Parent/Guardian can modify DMA settings during
after school hours</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Option B:</strong> DMA will be inactive during after school hours
<br>
<br>*Please note that for Option B, parents/guardians or the school will <strong><u>not</u></strong> be
able to monitor or control their child’s/ward’s use of their device after
school hours, and there will be no restrictions to ensure their online

content. Parent Portal is not available for Option B as the DMA will be
inactive after school hours</p>
