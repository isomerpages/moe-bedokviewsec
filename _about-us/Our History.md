<h1>History of Bedok View Secondary School</h1>
<p>Bedok View Secondary School was established and housed at Siglap Malay
School as a holding school in January 1977. It started with 5 classes in
the English stream and 4 in the Chinese Stream. Mr Mohd Said B H A Samad,
the principal-designate, served the school for three and a half years until
June 1981. Mr Soh Guan Ba took over as the principal from June 1981 to
December 1995. Mr Ee Chye Heng joined the school from 1995 to 2000, after
which Mr Khairunan bin Ali took over the post. From 2008 to 2011, Mr Boo
Chong Han was principal and Mr Jeffrey Low took over as principal from
2012 to 2015. Mrs Valerie Pinto took over the post from 2016 to 2020. From
December 2020 till 2024, Mdm Yvonne Teo was principal before the current
principal, Ms Cheng Hwee Yeang joined the school in December 2024.</p>
<p>In January 1978, the school began functioning in the present premises
and was officially opened on 28th September 1979 by Tuan Haji Sha’ari Tadin,
the former MP for Bedok. It was the 139th school built by the government
and it was also the first government secondary school to be built within
Bedok New Town.</p>
<p>In 1992, major alterations and renovations to the existing building and
the construction of the 4-storey classroom block were carried out under
the Extension and Alteration Project. With the completion of the E and
A Project, the school now has 36 classrooms, a commerce room, 4 computer
laboratories and 6 science laboratories. Extension to the library, staff
room and canteen were also carried out. In 1998, through the Repair &amp;
Repainting Programme, the school was repainted and given a facelift. The
school now provides a more comfortable and conducive environment for teaching
and learning. The school had undergone PRIME in 2003 and the project was
completed in mid-2005. An Indoor Sports Hall and synthetic soccer field
were completed and are now available for the use of the public. General
Repair and Redecoration (GR&amp;R) works commenced in 2020. Repainting
of the school façade and interiors, returfing of the synthetic field and
resurfacing of the netball and basketball courts were completed at the
end of the year.</p>
<p>In 2015, the school embarked on its distinctive Applied Learning Programme
(ALP) and Lifelong Learning Programme (LLP). The school’s ALP, Global Awareness
for the 21st Century@BV, centres on developing Bedok Viewans to be confident
communicators and critical thinkers with a sense of global awareness. The
school’s LLP, Good Values@BV, focuses on providing opportunities for moral
action and constant reflection to reinforce school values and to internalise
the CCE learning outcomes. It also seeks to provide students with real-life
experiential learning, develop soft skills and opportunities to self-reflection
through all CCAs.</p>
<p>Bedok View celebrated its 40th Anniversary, in 2017, with the theme ‘Blazing
a Trail @40’, encapsulating its achievements of 4 decades. The BV Lighthouse,
the school symbol was constructed, and the Heritage Wall was created. Our
Guest-of-Honour, BV Alumnus, Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim (Minister of State,
Ministry of Home Affairs &amp; Ministry of National Development) unveiled
the Lighthouse and launched the Heritage Wall. The first BV corporate video
ever produced also made its debut during the event. The school also brought
back FAME – the Festival of Arts, Movement and Entrepreneurship - on 30
June 2017 to celebrate Youth Day with a fun-filled, energetic, and meaningful
festival in which staff and students showcased their talents in the Arts
and had fun with sports and being an entrepreneur for a day. Proceeds from
the FAME bazaar and the sale of the 40th Anniversary souvenir bears, Blaze
and Ruby, were donated to the Make-A-Wish Foundation. The inaugural Aesthetics
Gallery, a collaborative project by Art students and teachers was also
launched. For the first time in BV’s history, the 40th Anniversary Alumni
Homecoming dinner took place on 22 September. The nostalgic evening, bonding
present and past students and teachers spanning over 30 years, was celebrated
in our school hall. In 2022, BV celebrated its 45th anniversary with the
theme “Beacons of Hope”. It was hoped that all Bedok Viewans light the
way for their peers, family, community and the nation especially in uncertain
and unprecedented times. As part of the anniversary programme, the school
organised the Gift It Bag Campaign in collaboration with Timbre Group to
raise awareness of the ongoing green efforts beyond the school and how
we all can contribute towards making Singapore a more sustainable city.</p>
<p>The Bedok View story continues with many more dreams to be achieved and
accolades to be harnessed as we enter 2025.</p>
