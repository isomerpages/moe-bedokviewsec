### Student Leaders’ Investiture 2021

The annual Student Leaders’ Investiture 2021 was held on 26th April 2021. The ceremony recognises and appreciates the hard work and effort of our outgoing leaders from the various student leader groups such as the Student Council, Student Peer Supporters, CCA groups and Class Leaders. It is also an annual event to formally appoint the incoming student leaders to their roles and responsibilities, as they beam with pride and receive their leaders’ badge from their teachers.

Due to the ongoing pandemic, the investiture took on a modified approach, with the event being pre-recorded and played in classrooms. Yet, Bedok Viewans rise to the occasion to give our leaders a rousing applause, giving warm support and encouraging their peers to stay dedicated to their leadership roles.

The investiture is an important event for student leaders to remember their commitment to be exemplary role models and to inspire the student population in seizing opportunities to lead self, peers and community.

### FAME 2021

The Festival of Arts, Movements and Entrepreneurship (FAME) is an annual event that celebrates the energy and spirit of Bedok Viewans through an Arts Showcase, Sports Carnival and Entrepreneurship Projects.

This year, Bedok Viewans take on the role of a social entrepreneurship to effect a positive social change in their community with the use of innovative ideas, through the lenses of environmental sustainability, health and fitness, and community improvement.

Be it their mission to create a video to impart knowledge, teach a skill or to advocate a change, Bedok Viewans had an enjoyable time experimenting with different video-editing software producing their own original content all to make that difference.
