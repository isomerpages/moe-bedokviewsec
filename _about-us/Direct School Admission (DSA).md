### Direct School Admission 2022

Bedok View Secondary School is a government co-educational secondary school and is a school of choice for many. Guided by the 2RISE school values of Respect, Responsibility, Integrity, Service and Excellence, our mission is to Nurture Bedok Viewans who Aspire, Strive and Dare as Learners and Leaders. It is our vision to develop Learners Who Learn for Life and Leaders Who Light the Way.

 

For primary six pupils considering DSA application to join Bedok View Secondary School in 2022, the school will offer the talent areas of

1. Leadership 
 
3. Media/Journalism

 

The Student Leadership programme at Bedok View Secondary School is closely linked to our school’s Learning for Life Programme (LLP), Good Values @BV and it aims to develop students into confident and inspiring leaders. We engage student leaders by equipping them with leadership skills so that they can grow to be responsible and respectful leaders and citizens. We also provide various platforms and opportunities for student leaders to demonstrate their leadership skills and to serve the community.

 


The Media/Journalism programme in Bedok View Secondary School is offered under the school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP), Global Awareness for the 21st Century @ BV. The ALP is a distinctive school programme, which aims to nurture global citizens who are critical thinkers and effective communicators. It does so by leveraging media and journalism lessons, workshops and projects for students to be equipped with media literacies, oratorical skills and journalism skills. Students are provided with opportunities within school, as well as external competitions and events, to apply the skills they have learned.
