<p>On behalf of the school, a warm welcome to Bedok View Secondary School’s
website!</p>
<p>Here is a short introduction of the school from the Principal’s desk…</p>
<p>When you first enter the school, you will be greeted by the ‘BV Lighthouse’.
The lighthouse is our school’s symbol, a symbolic representation of the
importance of a guiding light that directs our thoughts and actions. A
lighthouse on a strong foundation is able to withstand the unyielding waves
of change and challenges, and this is what we aspire for every Bedok Viewan.
Our vision for Bedok Viewans is to be <strong><em>Learners who learn for life and Leaders who light the way.</em></strong> Each
school day is one where they enter a safe and nurturing environment that
upholds the values of Respect, Responsibility, Integrity, Service and Excellence
(2RISE).</p>
<p>Our school’s distinctive Applied Learning Programme (ALP) – <strong>Global Awareness for the 21st Century @ BV</strong> –
connects academic learning to the real world to inspire BV Learners who
learn for life. All Bedok Viewans will experience our <strong>BV Navigator</strong> Programme
which brings together the learning goals of our ALP, Project Work, STEM
(disciplines of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) and 21st
Century Competencies (specifically Adaptive and Inventive Thinking, Communication
and Civic Literacy). Through learning experiences in areas such as Broadcast
Journalism, current affairs and attachments to industries, our students
have hands-on and authentic learning opportunities to hone their learning
dispositions to be critical thinkers with global awareness and grow to
be confident and effective communicators.</p>
<p>Our school’s Learning for Life Programme - <strong>Good Values @ BV</strong> –
aims to engender positive attitudes and outstanding character traits in
Bedok Viewans to be Leaders who light the way. Through a two-tiered programme,
Bedok Viewans ‘learn, act, lead and teach’ to be change agents and leaders
of exemplary character in their community and beyond. Our student leadership
programme is anchored on <strong>The Leadership Challenge</strong> (by Kouzes
and Posner) where we aim to instill the 5 leadership practices of ‘Model
the Way’, ‘Inspire a Shared Vision’, ‘Challenge the Process’, ‘Enable Others
to Act’ and ‘Encourage the Heart’. We believe <strong>every Bedok Viewan is a leader</strong> and
students take on leadership roles to lead and shine as well-balanced individuals
who serve and give above and beyond.</p>
<p>What makes Bedok View Secondary School different from other schools and
are we a ‘good school’? All schools are good schools in their own ways
and thus a more important question is how a school brings out the good
in every child. At Bedok View, <strong>our staff are committed to journey with Bedok Viewans as they aspire, strive, dare</strong> to
be at their best for a better future, not just during their school years
but beyond. We do this through i) <strong>delivering a balanced, rigorous and relevant curriculum</strong> (in
academic and non-academic domains), and ii) providing pastoral care and
socio-emotional support for <strong>positive well-being</strong>.</p>
<p>Another unique characteristic of Bedok View is the <strong>supportive partners</strong> we
have on board with us. Other than our parents and Parent Support Group
Exco, we also have our School Advisory Committee and community partners
from Siglap and Bedok whom we work closely with to extend learning opportunities.
While our school is relatively young (we are reaching 50 years only in
2027!), our BV alumni and Youth Wing have been a strong pillar of support
and many are generous in giving back to the school with their time, resources
and expertise. Our school also has a special and strong partnership with
APSN Katong School, where joint programmes are planned regularly for both
staff and students across both schools to inculcate a sense of community
spirit, appreciate diversity and engage in collaborative learning as a
shared community.</p>
<p>With the affordance of technology and advancements in the virtual and
digital space, the school stays abreast to and proactively adapts with
new ways of transforming learners’ experiences through Education Technology.
Building on MOE’s <strong>National Digital Literacy Programme</strong> and
the introduction of the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP),
Bedok Viewans are taught to learn independently as well as collaboratively
by leveraging the abundance of resources and tools online to support and
enrich their learning. As they go through e-learning experiences such as
in-class or Home-Based Learning Days, Bedok Viewans grow in their digital
literacy skills to navigate the virtual world and learn to be <strong>confident and responsible digital learners today for tomorrow.</strong>

<p>Please visit the different pages in our website for more information of
who we are including details of our CCAs, departments and committees etc.
Each of the pages contribute a glimpse of what makes the BV experience
meaningful and illuminating, as what a lighthouse does be it in calm or
rough seas.</p>
<p>I look forward to welcoming you to our school and also for you to be part
of the discovery, celebration and writing of new stories for our Bedok
Viewans!</p>
<p><strong>We Aspire, We Strive, We Dare <br>for a better future!</strong>
