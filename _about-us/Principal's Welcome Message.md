<img align="left" style="width: 50%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Principal.png">As you step into Bedok View Secondary School, you will be greeted by our
iconic 'BV Lighthouse'. This symbol represents more than just a structure;
it embodies our commitment to providing a guiding light for our students'
thoughts and actions. Like a lighthouse that stands firm and confronts
the waves of challenges and stormy weather conditions,&nbsp; we aim to
build a solid foundation for every Bedok Viewan.<p></p>
<p>Our vision remains steadfast: to nurture Learners who learn for life and
Leaders who light the way. Each school day offers a safe and nurturing
environment that upholds our core values of Respect, Responsibility, Integrity,
Service and Excellence (2RISE).</p>
<p>In 2025, we will continue to emphasise on the three guiding principles
that shape BV’s curriculum design and schooling experience:</p>
<p></p>
<p><u>Honing Skills</u>: Our distinctive Applied Learning Programme (ALP)
– Global Awareness for the 21st Century @ BV – aims to connect classroom
learning with real-world applications.</p>
<p>The BV Navigator Programme integrates our ALP, Project Work, STEM disciplines,
and 21st Century Competencies, providing immersive experiences in areas
such as STEM learning, Broadcast Journalism, and industry attachments.
These opportunities cultivate critical thinking, global awareness, and
effective communication skills.</p>
<p><u>Strengthening Character</u>: Our Learning for Life Programme - Good
Values @ BV – focuses on developing outstanding character traits. Through
our two-tiered programme, students, &nbsp;‘learn, act, lead and teach'
to become change agents and leaders of exemplary character. Anchored on
The Leadership Challenge, we instill the five leadership practices that
empower every Bedok Viewan to shine as a well-balanced individual who serves
beyond self.</p>
<p><u>Broadening Perspectives</u>: We have enhanced our curriculum to offer
a truly broad-based education. By integrating diverse subjects, harnessing
the affordance in educational technology, encouraging interdisciplinary
thinking, and providing exposure to various fields, we aim to broaden our
students' horizons and prepare them for an ever-changing world.</p>
<p>As we approach our 50th anniversary in 2027, we are proud of our strong
partnerships with the community, parents, and alumni network. These collaborations
enrich our students' learning experiences and provide diverse opportunities
for growth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;To our new students, I offer this assurance: at Bedok View, you
will find a community dedicated to bringing out the best in you. We are
committed to journeying with you as you aspire, strive, and dare to be
your best, not just during your school years, but beyond.</p>
<p>Let me leave you with these inspiring words from the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">poem "The Lighthouse" by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</a>:&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>"Steadfast, serene, immovable, the same</em>
<br><em>Year after year, through all the silent night</em>
<br><em>Burns on forevermore that quenchless flame,</em>
<br><em>Shines on that inextinguishable light!"</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like the steadfast lighthouse in Longfellow's poem, may your education
at Bedok View be a guiding light in your life journey. I encourage all
Bedok Viewans to embrace lifelong learning, leveraging the broad-based
education we offer and aspire to become leaders who light the way for yourselves,
others, and the greater community.</p>
<p>We Aspire, We Strive, We Dare for a better future!</p>
