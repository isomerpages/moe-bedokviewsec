On behalf of the school, a warm welcome to Bedok View Secondary School!

When you enter the school you will see the BV Lighthouse. It is a symbolic representation of a guiding light that directs our thoughts and actions. A lighthouse on a strong foundation is able to withstand the unyielding waves of change and challenges, and this is what we aspire for every Bedok Viewan.

As our students experience the richness of the national curriculum and school programmes, our vision is for them to be learners who learn for life and leaders who light the way in a home environment where every Bedok Viewan embodies the values of Respect, Responsibility, Integrity, Service and Excellence (2RISE). At our Parade Square we have a banner that reads ‘Home to Bedok Viewans’. This serves not only to welcome our students, but also reflects our commitment in providing a safe and nurturing environment for all to learn and grow together.

Our school’s distinctive Applied Learning Programme – **Global Awareness for the 21st Century @ BV** – connects academic learning to the real world. Through learning experiences related to Broadcast Journalism, we aim to nurture critical thinkers with global awareness and confident communicators who effectively engage with others. Our Learning for Life Programme – **Good Values @ BV** – aims to engender positive attitudes and outstanding character traits in every Bedok Viewan. Through a two-tiered programme, Bedok Viewans ‘learn, act, lead and teach’ to be leaders of exemplary character.

I joined Bedok View Secondary in 2021, right in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Certainly the pandemic has brought about many unexpected disruptions and challenges, but together with the staff, our school’s priority remains -to minimise disruptions to quality learning while keeping the school community safe. Winston Churchill once said, **‘Never let a good crisis go to waste’**. The constraints of COVID-19 nudged us to refocus, rethink and repurpose, resulting in many ‘firsts’ as we continue to provide learning and leadership opportunities for our Bedok Viewans. For example, Home-based Learning days now form part of the regular school experience in the academic and non-academic domains, even when students are not physically in school. Assessments are also no longer just about tests and exams, but done through different methods to help students learn better.

Some may ask what makes Bedok View Secondary School different from other schools and are we a ‘good school’. All schools are good schools in their own ways so the more important question is how a school is most suited in bringing out the good in a student. How do we do this at Bedok View Secondary? Regardless of the different roles we have, each of us lives out our school motto **‘we aspire, strive, dare for a better future’** to be at our best:
