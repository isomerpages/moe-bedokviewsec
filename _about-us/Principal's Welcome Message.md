On behalf of the school, a warm welcome to Bedok View Secondary School!

 We celebrate our school’s 45th Anniversary in 2022, commemorating 45 years of nurturing Bedok Viewans, past and present, as beacons of hope. The theme for the year is **‘Light the Way’**, taking reference from the lighthouse, our school’s symbol. One of the first visuals that greets you when you enter the school is the BV Lighthouse, a symbolic representation of a guiding light that directs our thoughts and actions. A lighthouse on strong foundation is able to withstand the unyielding waves of change and challenges, which is what we aspire for every Bedok Viewan. In the year ahead, we look forward to many more meaningful partnerships with our parents, the PSG and the Alumni to support our Bedok Viewans in staying strong and steadfast to pursue their aspirations and potential so that they will find the guiding light for themselves and also be that light to others around them.


At our parade square, the topmost banner reads ‘Home to Bedok Viewans’. This serves not only to welcome back our Bedok Viewans every new school day, but also reflects our commitment as a school in providing a safe and nurturing environment for all to learn and grow together. As our students experience the richness of the national curriculum and school programmes, our vision is for them to be **learners who learn for life and leaders who light the way** in a home environment where every Bedok Viewan embodies the values of **Respect, Responsibility, Integrity, Service and Excellence (2RISE).**

Our school’s distinctive Applied Learning Programme – Global Awareness for the 21st Century @ BV – connects academic learning to the real world. Through learning experiences related to Broadcast Journalism, we aim to nurture critical thinkers with global awareness and confident communicators who effectively engage with others. Our Learning for Life Programme – Good Values @ BV – aims to engender positive attitudes and outstanding character traits in every Bedok Viewan. Through a two-tiered programme, Bedok Viewans ‘learn, act, lead and teach’ to be leaders of exemplary character.


I joined Bedok View Secondary in 2021, right in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Certainly the pandemic has brought about many unexpected disruptions and challenges, but together with the staff, our school’s priority to minimise disruptions to quality learning while keeping the school community safe remains. Winston Churchill once said, ‘**Never let a good crisis go to waste**’. Indeed the constraints of COVID-19 nudged us to refocus, rethink and repurpose, resulting in many ‘firsts’ as we continue to provide learning and leadership opportunities for our Bedok Viewans. Home-based Learning days now form part of the regular school experience where asynchronous and synchronous teaching that leverage ICT tools in the academic and non-academic domains are conducted, even when students are not physically in school. Our first BV Virtual Run as part of our National Day celebrations in 2021 reminded us about the importance of finding new and exciting ways to stay connected, active and well as one community. An inaugural BV e-Townhall was organised for our student leaders to engage with teachers and school leaders on current issues and leadership experiences. Such engagement platforms encouraged open conversations that strengthened the sense of pride and belonging as one BV community whilst allowing our young Bedok Viewans to glean new insights on current issues and priorities, such as overcoming COVID-19 challenges, adapting to educational changes and being good peer supporters to ensure the well-being of every Bedok Viewan.

Some may ask what makes Bedok View Secondary School different from other schools and how are we a ‘good school’. All schools are good schools in their own ways and the more important question is how a school is most suited for a student such that it brings out the good in him and her. There are many ‘factors’ but at Bedok View Secondary, I would say it is best defined by how regardless of the different roles we have in the BV family, each of us lives out our school motto ‘**we aspire, strive, dare for a better future’.**

* Bedok Viewans are not just my students, but my ‘teachers’. They have taught me how staying relentless and inquisitive to learn beyond the classroom and circumstance brings about true joy of learning. Others have showed tenacity and courage to grow from mistakes or failures, never afraid of trying again (and again). In my interactions with students, I have been blessed to meet many Bedok Viewans who chose the ‘need’ over the ‘want’, the ‘right’ over the ‘easy’ and the ‘we’ over the ‘me, myself and I’.

* I have also met with BV alumni who are generous in giving back to the school with their time and resources. In their own ways they make time for the school to express their deep gratitude for the meaningful experiences they enjoyed with friends and teachers and the impact the school has made on their lives.

<br>

* Parents, particularly the Parent Support Group, are the unsung heros, with some serving even when their children have graduated. They render their support to the school and other parents in quiet ways, and are most generous with their care, affirmations and encouragements to the staff and students whenever the opportunity arises.

<br>

* Most of all, it is the strong camaraderie and professionalism of the staff that I am humbled by. Despite managing personal challenges and struggles of their own, their tenacity to stay true to the profession, going above and beyond to care for our students and one another in the BV family have made every BV staff an authentic positive role-model for our Bedok Viewans.

Each of these individuals/groups reflect the collective testament to the BV culture – to be a lighthouse that shines brightly to bring hope, be it in peace time and even more so in the midst of strong winds and waves. 


Please do check out the different pages in our website for a glimpse of who we are, and also to relish some of the stories of our BV community. I look forward to welcoming you to our school and to be part of the discovery, celebration and writing of new stories for our Bedok Viewans.   


**We Aspire, We Strive, We Dare
for a better future!**
