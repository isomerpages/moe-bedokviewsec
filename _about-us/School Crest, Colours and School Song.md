## School Crest

     style="width:60%">

The Lighthouse is our school symbol and is depicted on our school crest.  It represents the fire of passion and guiding light to direct our thoughts and actions. 

A strong and steadfast monument resting on a solid foundation, it is able to withstand the waves of change and challenges. It also symbolises our aspirations to achieve high standards of integrity, strong character, and resilience.

## School Colours

Blue: Symbolises an endless quest for knowledge and character development <br>
Beige: Represents determination and joy in achieving our dreams


## School Song

We can, we will, we must, <br>
Better this place of ours. <br>
Never quit, always strive, <br>
With the beacon to guide. 



Bedok View Secondary School, <br>
Our pride, Our hope, Our aspiration. <br>
Here we plan and work to serve, <br>
To serve this nation. <br>
For a Better, <br>
Better Future. <br>
For a Better Future. <br>


With grit, and vigour, and drive, <br>
Problems we must surmount, <br>
To reach greater heights, <br>
Where we stand with pride.



Bedok View Secondary School, <br>
Our pride, Our hope, Our aspiration. <br>
Here we plan and work to serve, <br>
To serve this nation. <br>
For a Better, Better Future, <br>
For a Better Future. <br>
