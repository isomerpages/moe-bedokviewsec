### Who are we

The Parent Support Group is made up of parent volunteers of past and current Bedok View Students. They form a strong partnership with the school by organising and supporting us in our various school events. 

### Our Structure

A strong parent-school partnership is essential in developing our students to their full potential and enabling them to fulfil their aspirations. We are heartened that the school has a very dedicated and supportive Parent Support Group who works very closely with the school.

We offer multiple platforms for stakeholders to work together to deliver a quality and holistic education for the students. As we move towards post pandemic, we are thankful to have our parents join us in many of our events. We would like to acknowledge and show appreciation for the strong support of our PSG. We are indeed grateful for their contributions to the holistic development of our students.

During F.A.M.E. , the PSG set up a booth to promote a green culture and sustainability. They conducted a workshop to teach students how to plant seedlings.

Our PSG has always been generous in the way they care for our students. For instance, their commitment was strongly felt in our Afternoon Study Programme. Our PSG provided snacks, fruits and drinks for both teachers and students.   

To show their appreciation to our teachers on Teachers’ Day, the PSG lovingly prepared customised cupcakes for every teaching and non-teaching staff.  

The PSG generously sponsored chocolates for our graduating students, to celebrate their graduation and to wish them the best for their upcoming national examinations.  

We thank and look forward to the continued support of the PSG in providing a holistic support and partnership for our students.
