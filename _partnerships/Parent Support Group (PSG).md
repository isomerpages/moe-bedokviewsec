### Who are we

The Parent Support Group is made up of parent volunteers of past and current Bedok View Students. They form a strong partnership with the school by organising and supporting us in our various school events. 

### Our Structure

As the saying goes, “it takes a village to raise a child”. Indeed, during this Covid-19 pandemic, the “village” must come together and find ways to support and develop our students’ learning and development. In Bedok View Secondary School, we are very thankful to have a group of committed parents who are willing to contribute their time and effort to help build a more conducive environment for our students.

With the ongoing pandemic, we are not able to have any face to face touch points with our PSG members, but this has not stopped them in contributing to the school and helping out in facilitating events virtually or remotely.

Our PSG Executive Committee members conducted an online zoom session in January to welcome Secondary 1 parents as members of PSG. They also had online zoom touchpoint with our school leaders to understand new directives and provide their inputs and feedback to the school.

Our PSG has always been generous in the way they care for our students. For instance, their commitment was strongly felt in our afternoon study programme. Despite the fact that social distancing was limiting their access into the school, our PSG continued to provide individual sets of snacks and drinks for both teachers and students.

To show appreciation to our teachers, the PSG ordered customised cupcakes for every teaching and non-teaching staff of the school during the Teachers' Day Appreciation week.

The PSG also ordered souvenirs for our graduating students to celebrate their graduation after 4 or 5 years in the school as well as to wish them all the best for their upcoming National Examination.

We thank and look forward to the continued support of the PSG in providing a holistic support and partnership for our students.
