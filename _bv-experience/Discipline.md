### Discipline Framework

Effective discipline is based on a consistent philosophy and approach. Every student matters and the school aims to nurture a caring school culture and a positive school climate. Such a climate is based on a calm yet firm insistence on high standards of behaviour at all times. To this effect, the school has formulated a set of clear and reasonable school rules to guide the students, which emphasises both reason and compassion, to help students change for their betterment. 

 School discipline also means the obligation of teachers and students to follow a code of conduct known usually as school rules. These regulations define exactly what is expected of model student behaviour and the consequences in the event that the student violates this standard. At the same time, our school creates a supportive environment by teaching values, social and emotional skills, and providing opportunities for students to exercise good behaviour by guiding and re-orientating students who have erred in their ways. A Whole School Approach towards Discipline is thus adopted, with the aim of developing our students’ self-discipline so that they become individuals who take responsibility for their decisions and actions. 

 The school has adopted the ‘4 P’ Framework to discipline, which stands for being Proactive, Preventive, Pastoral and having good Partnerships with parents and external agencies to enhance the quality of the school as a community and to help maintain high expectations.

7.2	Bedok Viewans should queue in an orderly manner to buy food or drinks in the canteen. <br>

7.3	Bedok Viewans are to make it their duty to return plates and cutlery to the respective containers provided by the food stalls as this helps in maintaining the general appearance and cleanliness of the canteen. <br>

7.4	Bedok Viewans are also expected to be responsible and considerate in the use of all equipment and facilities within the school at all times. <br>

7.5	Any defacing of furniture or misuse of equipment is a serious offence and is considered an act of vandalism. Offenders may be required to pay for the repair or replacement of damaged property.

**8.	Smoking**

8.1	Smoking is illegal for all individuals who are under the age of 21, and it is also prohibited in public places within the compounds of educational institutions. <br>

8.2	Smoking is a serious offence. We do not want Bedok Viewans to pick up this unhealthy habit during their formative years in school. Students caught smoking within or outside the school premises are liable to face serious consequences in school.

**9.	Behaviour in Public**

**10.	Use of Electronic Devices**

10.6	These devices can only be used during recess, after curriculum hours and after school activities or events. If these devices have to be used within curriculum hours or during school activities and events, the teachers will grant permission to the students. Conversely, students may request permission from their teachers for the use of the devices. Permission will be granted on a case-by-case basis and the decisions of the teachers will be final. <br>

10.7	The staff of the school has the right to confiscate these devices if they are not kept away or used responsibly, sensitively, and appropriately, after repeated reminders. Once confiscated, these devices may be returned to the student at a later time and the student would be deemed to have committed an offence. In some instances, the school may require the presence of a parent or guardian before the confiscated device is returned to the student.

**11.	Classroom Conduct**
