<p>Bedok View Drama Club gives students the opportunity to develop confidence
on stage. Through staging and acting, students ignite their imagination
as they bring characters and scenarios to life. Students participate in
activities such as script-writing, vocal delivery and body posturing to
develop a flair for on-stage speaking, movement, and writing. There are
ample opportunities for experiential learning in the various areas of dramaturgy.
Through school-based performances, students are also able to put their
skills and knowledge to the test. The Drama Club aims to develop students
who are poised, bold and dynamic communicators and artists in the future.</p>
<p>In 2021, the Drama Club participated in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF)
Arts Presentation, showcasing a moving and insightful piece that highlighted
the importance of family connections and mental health in the times of
safe distancing and technological estrangement. In 2022, the Drama Club
embarked on two school-based performances that brought to life hot-button
issues of racial harmony, empathy, and preserving traditions in the face
of modernity. The dedication and excellence that each actor and crew member
put in made the experience so unforgettable and fulfilling for all involved.</p>
