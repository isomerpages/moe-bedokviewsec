### CCA Overview & Highlights

Bedok View Drama Club gives students the opportunity to develop confidence on stage. Through staging and acting, students ignite their imagination as they bring characters and scenarios to life. Students participate in activities such as script-writing, vocal delivery and body posturing to develop a flair for speaking and writing. There are ample opportunities for membersâ€™ experiential learning through school and external performances. The Drama Club aims to develop students who are poised, bold and dynamic communicators and artists in the future.  

In 2021, we participated in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation whereby our members persevered to perfect their performance which resulted in a piece that was moving and insightful, highlighting the importance of family connections and mental health in the times of safe distancing and technological estrangement. The dedication and excellence that each actor and crew member put in made the experience so unforgettable and fulfilling for all involved.
