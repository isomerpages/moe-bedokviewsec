<h3>CCA Overview &amp; Highlights</h3>
<p>Bedok View Modern Dance Club allows individuals to discover and nurture
their talent in dance, by exposing students to different dance genres which
range from street jazz, hip hop and more.</p>
<p>Trainings are held twice a week to help students improve their physical
strength, foundation techniques, choreography and performance. Through
choreographing our own routines and working with fellow dance mates, students
develop resilience, discipline, independence, and learn how to communicate,
cooperate and compromise well as a team.</p>
<p>Our CCA provides many opportunities for students to perform during school
events, participate in Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) and competitions
such as Super24.</p>
