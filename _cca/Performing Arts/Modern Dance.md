<h3>CCA Overview &amp; Highlights</h3>
<p>Bedok View Modern Dance Club is a talent incubator that immerses students
in diverse dance genres, from hip hop and urban to street jazz. Trainings
are held twice a week, focusing on enhancing physical strength, foundational
techniques, and choreography skills.</p>
<p>Beyond the dance floor, the programme cultivates resilience, discipline,
and teamwork. Through creating our own routines and collaborating, students
learn essential skills such as communication, cooperation, and compromise.</p>
<p>Our co-curricular activity (CCA) boasts a strong performance record. We
offer numerous opportunities for public performances, including school
events and competitions. In April this year, we earned a four-star achievement
in the 2024 Open Dance Competition organised by the Peopleâ€™s Association.
Additionally, Bedok View Modern Dance Club has been consistently awarded
a Distinction at the SYF for the last three consecutive rounds, including
2023.</p>
