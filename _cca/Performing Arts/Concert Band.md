<h3>CCA Overview &amp; Highlights</h3>
<p>In its pursuit of excellence, the BV Concert Band equips students with
the necessary skills to enhance their proficiency in music as well as play
confidently to an audience. The band performs a wide variety of repertoire,
including popular contemporary songs and band classics. The band members
rose to the occasion at the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation
2023, where their hard work and resilience culminated in their achievement
of the coveted Certificate of Accomplishment. Our band leaders are passionate
and empowered to be the guiding light of other members. Every band senior
makes it their responsibility to mentor and guide junior members to develop
their skills in mastering their instrument. As a band that constantly goes
above and beyond in order to improve, the Bedok View Concert Band continues
to be the light to others in their school and community.</p>
