### CCA Overview &amp; Highlights

In its pursuit of excellence, the BV Concert Band equips students with the necessary skills to enhance their proficiency in music as well as play confidently to an audience. The band performs a wide variety of repertoire, including popular contemporary songs and band classics. The band members rose to the occasion at the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation 2023, where their hard work and resilience culminated in their achievement of the coveted Certificate of Accomplishment. Our band leaders are passionate and empowered to be the guiding light of other members. Every band senior makes it their responsibility to mentor and guide junior members to develop their skills in mastering their instrument. As a band that constantly goes above and beyond in order to improve, the Bedok View Concert Band continues to be the light to others in their school and community.
