### CCA Overview & Highlights

Bedok View Guzheng Ensemble provides students with the opportunity to pick up Guzheng performing skills, and boost their team spirit. Through polishing their technical playing skills in every training session, we seek to enable students to achieve excellence. We also focus on further developing the members’ values of responsibility and resilience, in order to develop them holistically. 

 In 2021, we had meaningful and fulfilling experiences from putting in our best efforts to prepare and perform festive pieces during the school’s Chinese New Year Celebration, as well as from our participation in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation. Guzheng members continued to learn and work together as one to bring the group to greater heights.
