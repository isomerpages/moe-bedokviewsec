<h3>CCA Overview &amp; Highlights</h3>
<p>Bedok View Guzheng ensemble aims to provide a platform for students to
venture into the beauty of the Guzheng instrument. Our CCA highlights the
importance of working cohesively as a team and focuses on improving one
another, with seniors actively providing support for new members.</p>
<p>A typical CCA session consists of preparing for SYF as well as playing
other songs used for performances. A lot of time is taken to refine our
techniques and make the song more expressive through movements and dynamic
contrasts in the music. Beyond music practice, our CCA fosters a strong
sense of camaraderie through a variety of activities such as bonding sessions,
Teachersâ€™ Day celebration, and farewell party for our graduating seniors.</p>
<p>In 2023, we participated in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation
and received the Certificate of Distinction. In 2024, our CCA went on an
exchange programme with Hougang Secondary School to further enhance our
knowledge of Guzheng in Singapore, and gain valuable insights from other
students. This enabled us to engage with students from other schools and
foster new connections.</p>
