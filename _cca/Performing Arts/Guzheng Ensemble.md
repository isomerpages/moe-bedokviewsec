<h3>CCA Overview &amp; Highlights</h3>
<p>Bedok View Guzheng Ensemble provides students with the opportunity to
pick up Guzheng performing skills, and boost their team spirit. Through
polishing their technical playing skills in every training session, we
seek to enable students to achieve excellence. We also focus on further
developing the members’ values of responsibility and resilience, in order
to develop them holistically.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;In 2021, we had meaningful and fulfilling experiences from putting
in our best efforts to prepare and perform festive pieces during the school’s
Chinese New Year Celebration, as well as from our participation in the
Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation.&nbsp;Guzheng members
continued to learn and work together as one to bring the group to greater
heights.</p>
