<h3>CCA Overview &amp; Highlights</h3>
<p>The Badminton CCA seeks to develop passionate players to their fullest
potential in their years in Bedok View. Rigorous trainings are conducted
to strengthen the physical and mental faculties of every player so as to
cultivate their perseverance to pursue the different skills needed for
competitive play. Players also develop mastery in the areas of their footwork
and racket handling. To further assess their skills and abilities, the
team participates in the yearly East Zone Badminton Competition and other
external competitions, where they also learn about sportsmanship, integrity
and making responsible decisions that uphold moral principles. Each year,
the team holds badminton clinics to give players opportunities to give
back to the community and impart their knowledge and skills to younger
players.</p>
<p>This year the B Division team fought hard and made it into the quarter-finals
of the National School Games (NSG) East Zone Championship. Against a group
of strong opponents, the boys learnt perseverance and resilience as they
stood their ground and gave their best. The experience was an enriching
and meaningful one for them.</p>
