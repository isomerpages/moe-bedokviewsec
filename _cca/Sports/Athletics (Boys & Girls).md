<h3>CCA Overview &amp; Highlights</h3>
<p>The Athletics CCA aims to reinforce the importance of passion and resilience,
and to develop all-round athletes. We have training sessions twice a week
in which the coach and teachers work together to train our students in
a variety of exercises like footwork drills and endurance-building. The
training sessions help students to master the correct techniques, build
their endurance and improve in their race timings. On top of that, we instill
the value of teamwork in our athletes, encouraging them to support and
celebrate each otherâ€™s success. Through their participation in competitions,
the athletes get exposure, learn about integrity, showcase good sportsmanship
and reap the fruits of their labour.</p>
