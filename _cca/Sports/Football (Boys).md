### CCA Overview &amp; Highlights

Football is more than just a sport. It requires a strong character that portrays perseverance, determination, discipline, resilience and teamwork. Football is a team sport that builds body and mental strength, agility and coordination.

Under the School Football Academy (SFA) programme and the guidance of a team of full-time coaches, our Football CCA aspires to produce young players with sound technical ability through frequent training sessions and games. The Football CCA also seeks to provide a space for young men from all walks of life to bond and build lifelong friendships over a shared passion for the game. 

In 2023, we are proud that both our B and C Div boys made it to the Quarter-Finals of League 4.
