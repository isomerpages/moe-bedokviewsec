<h3>CCA Overview &amp; Highlights</h3>
<p>Football is more than just a sport. It requires a strong character that
portrays perseverance, determination, discipline, resilience and teamwork.
Football is a team sport that builds body and mental strength, agility
and coordination.</p>
<p>Under the School Football Academy (SFA) programme and the guidance of
a team of full-time coaches, our Football CCA aspires to produce young
players with sound technical ability through frequent training sessions
and games. The Football CCA also seeks to provide a space for young men
from all walks of life to bond and build lifelong friendships over a shared
passion for the game.</p>
<p>In 2024, we are proud that our B Div boys made it to the Quarter-Finals
of League 3!
