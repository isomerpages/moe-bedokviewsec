### CCA Overview & Highlights

Football is more than just a sport. It requires a strong character that portrays perseverance, determination, discipline, resilience and teamwork. Football is a team sport that builds body and mental strength, agility and coordination.

In Bedok View, the Football CCA training programs pivot on guiding learning intentions and success criteria and aim to instil responsibility, confidence and discipline in our students. The players build up their skills and strength through trainings and gain experiences from tournaments. The football training sessions include conditioning and strength training, goalkeeper session and other activities and aim to develop the passion for football in our players with the guidance and expertise of dedicated and experienced coach and teachers. We not only focus on developing and honing the technical skills of our players, but also developing them into responsible self-leaders and an active contributors to the society.
