<h3>CCA Overview &amp; Highlights</h3>
<p>The Basketball CCA aims to develop confident and resilient players who
strive for continuous improvement and excellence.</p>
<p>We have training sessions twice a week in which coaches, teachers and
student leaders work together to train our students in a variety of exercises
like ball handling skills and tactical play. The training sessions help
students develop and master the correct techniques, build their confidence
and their sportsmanship.</p>
<p>We took part in the annual East Zone Basketball Competition and external
tournaments like the T-Net tournaments and ActiveSG Basketball Development
Leagues. The external competitions provided the players opportunities to
hone their skills,&nbsp;strengthen their teamwork and build their confidence.</p>
<p>In line with our school values, our students will continue to be resilient
and to strive for excellence in coming years.</p>
