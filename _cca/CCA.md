## CCA

CCA is an integral part of the students’ holistic education in school. Participation in a school-based CCA allows students to interact with students from other classes and levels. It also allows us to guide and chart the development of the student beyond the learning in the classroom, in areas such as leadership and character development and the 21st Century Competencies (21CC).
