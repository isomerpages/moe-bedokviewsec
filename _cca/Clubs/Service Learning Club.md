<p>We focus on engaging the whole being – the head (cognitive), the hands
(practical), and the heart (emotional), as shown below.</p>

<h4>Our Motto</h4>
<p>Serve.Learn.Care</p>
<h4>Our Values</h4>
<p>To Aspire, Serve and Achieve</p>
<h4>CCA Overview</h4>
<p>Bedok View Service Learning Club provides students with platforms and
opportunities to carry out community initiatives. Through these programmes,
we seek to develop the students’ leadership abilities, strengthen their
communication skills, and support the development of values in them. Students
broaden their perspectives and learn the importance of social cohesion
through working on various projects and with different community partners.
Alongside these programmes, students are also equipped with relevant soft
skills, including Maker Skills, Media and Digital Literacy, and Communication
skills. SLC members are exposed to various aspects of community initiatives
through the three arms: the Environment (with a focus on sustainability),
Service to the community, and Service within school.</p>
<p>Within the CCA, students will be exposed to different areas of Service
Learning in a tiered approach.</p>
<p>In Secondary 1, the focus will be on exposure as they participate in the
different activities organised by the club throughout the year.</p>
<p>As they enter Secondary 2, they will select an area of interest where
they will take on a more active role to organise, plan and lead some of
these activities within their selected areas.</p>
<p>In Secondary 3 and 4, they will continue to deepen their expertise in
their area of interest and to serve as a mentor to their juniors, or to
consider serving in another area to further their exposure before graduation.</p>
<h4>Leadership Opportunities</h4>
<p>In SLC, leadership is similar to the school’s general direction (see
<a href="https://www.bedokviewsec.moe.edu.sg/student-development/student-leadership/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>here</u>
</a>). As early as Secondary 2, students with potential are given the opportunity
to take on a formalised leadership role, where they are empowered to come
forward with initiatives and rally others towards a common goal.</p>
