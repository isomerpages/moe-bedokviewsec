### Our Motto

Serve.Learn.Care


### Our Values

To Aspire, serve and Achieve


### CCA Overview

Bedok View Service Learning Club provides students with platforms and opportunities to carry out community initiatives. Through these programmes, we seek to develop the students’ leadership abilities, strengthen their communication skills and instil values in them. Students broaden their perspectives and learn the importance of social cohesion through working on various projects and with different community partners.

This year, the SLC collaborated with the National Parks Board (NParks) to conduct meaningful lessons to pre-schoolers from My First Skool at the Kindergarten and Nursery levels. The lessons that the members conducted for the pre-schoolers were based on the theme of "City in Nature" and at the same time, educating pre-schoolers on how to respond when they encounter wildlife such as pigeons, macaques and pythons in their neighbourhoods.&nbsp;

There are plans for SLC members to learn more about sustainability and adopting green practices. Involvement in the Green Plan as well as the 3M Green Challenge @ South East are some of the examples that members of the SLC have taken part in.
