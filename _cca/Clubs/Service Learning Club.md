The framework for our CCA involves three sections shown below.

### Our Motto

Serve.Learn.Care


### Our Values

To Aspire, serve and Achieve


### CCA Overview

Bedok View Service Learning Club provides students with platforms and opportunities to carry out community initiatives. Through these programmes, we seek to develop the students’ leadership abilities, strengthen their communication skills and instil values in them. Students broaden their perspectives and learn the importance of social cohesion through working on community projects and with different community partners.

Through the years, our students learnt to befriend the elderly in our neighbourhood and plan engaging activities for them. They had the chance to take on the role of a teacher when they created science lesson packages and taught the Primary 5 and 6 students from APSN Katong School on topics such as recycling and plant life cycles.

In 2021, we continued to work closely with the Southeast CDC and THK Bedok Radiance Senior Citizen Centre. Our students remain enthusiastic and innovative in designing and planning their projects virtually to create videos and digital posters for the Dengue Project. They also designed a simple online game and created a Dengue Activity and Reflection Logbook for the senior citizens in Bedok. In school, our students broadcasted environmental news through the school’s weekly NewsBites and advocated recycling and upcycling of single-use plastics. The pandemic was a challenge for SLC, but it was a fulfilling and enriching experience for us.
