<h3>CCA Overview</h3>
<p>Bedok View Infocomm Club immerses its members in photography and videography
through a range of activities, including school events and outdoor shoots.
With guidance from our trainer, members develop their technical skills.
The PA crew, composed of our infocommers, assists the school by setting
up and managing media equipment. Our members also regularly compete in
photography contests such as Our School Our Stories and other national
events, applying their skills in practical settings. Through these activities
