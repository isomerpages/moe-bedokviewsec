<h3>CCA Overview</h3>
<p>Bedok View Infocomm Club engages its infocommers through photography and
videography with different activities like school events, outdoor shoots
and annual Infocomm Club camp. The members develop their technical skills
with the help of our trainer. The PA crew, which also consists of our infocommers,
assist the school in the setup and control of all media equipment. Our
