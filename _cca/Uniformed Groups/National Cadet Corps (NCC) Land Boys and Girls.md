<h3>CCA Overview &amp; Highlights</h3>
<p>The National Cadet Corps (NCC) Land Unit aims to develop responsible and
resilient leaders and team players through fun and challenging military-related
activities. Through these experiences, we strive to nurture self-motivated
leaders who embody resilient minds, fit bodies, and committed hearts —
ready to serve the unit, school, and nation.</p>
<p>During training sessions, cadets participate in drills, physical training,
and sports, which help to build fitness, discipline, and teamwork. They
also acquire military-related skills and knowledge such as handling the
SAR21 rifle, marksmanship, orienteering, individual fieldcraft, and urban
operations.</p>
<p>Beyond regular training, cadets enjoy opportunities to participate in
a range of engaging programmes, including the combined Uniformed Group
(UG) camp, and NCC HQ events such as Camp FORGE, Camp STEEL, the Senior
Specialist Leaders’ Course, as well as Sports Championship and orienteering
competitions.</p>
<p>Our unit also features the Precision Drill Squad (PDS) and Freestyle Drill
(FSD) teams. Cadets are auditioned and selected based on their drill sharpness,
coordination, and commitment. These teams regularly perform at competitions,
National Day celebrations, and outreach programmes for primary school students.
The PDS is a longstanding source of pride for the unit, having consistently
qualified for the Grand Finals in recent years. In 2025, the team achieved
a new milestone by securing second place in the 14th NCC PDS Competition
Grand Finals.</p>
<p>The unit has attained commendable achievements in recent years and strives
to continue upholding the high standards of the Corps.</p>

we will achieve greater heights in years to come.</p>
