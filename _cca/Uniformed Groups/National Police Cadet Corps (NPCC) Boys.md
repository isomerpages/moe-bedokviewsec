<h3>CCA Overview &amp; Highlights</h3>
<p>The <strong>National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC)</strong> unit aims to develop
cadets to be active citizens and community leaders, by working in partnership
with the <strong>Singapore Police Force</strong> to fight crime and keep
Singapore safe.</p>
<p>Our cadets learn important skills and knowledge with exciting programmes
such as <strong>Crime Scene Investigation (CSI)</strong> and <strong>0.22 Revolver Shooting</strong>,
and nurture their rugged selves through fun and challenging outdoor activities
such as <strong>Adventure Camps</strong> in <strong>Pulau Ubin</strong>. We
take part in the <strong>Police Youth Ambassador</strong> projects which
aims to equip cadets with practical strategies to address community crime
and security. We also collaborate with the <strong>Singapore Police Force</strong> to
help spread awareness on <strong>Vehicle Theft</strong> and <strong>Internet Scams</strong> to
the public. These projects help to develop our cadets into confident leaders
and responsible citizens of the nation.</p>
<p>In 2024, our unit received the <strong>Gold Award</strong> for the <strong>Unit Overall Proficiency Award (UOPA)</strong> as
a recognition of our cadets’ and officers’ commitment to high standards
of proficiency and efficiency in our programmes and achievements. Our Sec
4 cadets have also made the school proud yearly by achieving the <strong>SPF-NPCC Badge</strong>,
the pinnacle badge awarded to the best NPCC cadets in Singapore.</p>
<p><strong>We look forward to welcoming you to be part of our NPCC family!</strong>
