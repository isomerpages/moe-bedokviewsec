<h3>CCA Overview &amp; Highlights</h3>
<p>Girl Guides is a Co-Curricular activity that creates many leadership opportunities
for the girls. Through the patrol system, the juniors get to emulate the
leadership skills demonstrated by the seniors. The CCA encourages girls
to explore and develop their talents, to aim and achieve excellence and
also to help and serve others. Our girls worked hard to achieve various
proficiency badges during training sessions and often volunteered their
services during school and girl guides events. They volunteered in St Johnâ€™s
home for the elderly. They organized their own camp in Camp Christine and
had fun hiking and cooking outdoors.</p>
<p>In 2024, our girls demonstrated their talents and creativity during East
Division Day and as a testament to their hard work, they achieved a Silver
in one of the competitions. The CCA also achieved Puan Noor Aishah Gold
in the assessment year of 2025.</p>
