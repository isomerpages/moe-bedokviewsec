### CCA Overview & Highlights

The National Cadet Corps (NCC) Boys’ unit aims to develop responsible and resilient leaders and team players through fun and challenging military-related activities. Through these activities, we hope to develop the boys to become self-motivated leaders who embody resilient minds, fit bodies and committed hearts to serve the unit, school and nation.

The cadets are involved in drills, physical trainings and fun sports activities during their training sessions to train up their fitness levels and develop discipline. They also learn military-related skills and knowledge such as technical handling of the SAR21 rifle, marksmanship, orienteering, individual fieldcraft and urban operations.

The unit achieved the following awards in recent years and aims to continue to uphold high standards of the Corps:

* Gold awards for GOTC II Virtual Competition in 2021;
* Silver and Bronze awards for GOTC II Virtual Competition in 2020;
* 1st Runner-Up for Orienteering Competition in 2019;
* Distinction for the Unit Recognition Award in 2019.
