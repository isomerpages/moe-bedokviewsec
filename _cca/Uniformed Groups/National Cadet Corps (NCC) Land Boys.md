### CCA Overview &amp; Highlights


The **National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC**) unit aims to develop cadets to be active citizens and community leaders, by working in partnership with the **Singapore Police Force** to fight crime and keep Singapore safe.
 
Our cadets learn important skills and knowledge with exciting programmes such as** Crime Scene Investigation (CSI)** and **0.22 Revolver Shooting**, and nurture their rugged selves through fun and challenging outdoor activities like **High Ropes Challenge** and **Adventure Camps** in Pulau Ubin. We take part in the **Police Youth Ambassador** projects which aims to equip cadets with practical strategies to address community crime and security. We also collaborate with the **Singapore Police Force** to help spread awareness on **Vehicle Theft** and **Internet Scams** to the public. These projects help to develop our cadets into confident leaders and responsible citizens of the nation.

For many years, our unit has received the **Gold Award / Distinction Award** for the **Unit Overall Proficiency Award (UOPA)** as a recognition of our cadets’ and officers’ commitment to high standards of proficiency and efficiency in our programmes and achievements. Our Sec 4 cadets have also made the school proud yearly by achieving the **SPF-NPCC Badge**, the pinnacle badge awarded to the best NPCC cadets in Singapore.

We look forward to welcoming you to be part of our NPCC family!
