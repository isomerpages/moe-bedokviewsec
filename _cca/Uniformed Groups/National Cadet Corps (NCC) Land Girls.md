### CCA Overview & Highlights
The National Cadet Corps (NCC) Girlsâ€™ unit aims to develop responsible and resilient leaders and team players through fun and challenging activities. We hope to develop the girls to become self-motivated, with resilient minds, fit bodies and committed hearts to serve the unit, school and nation.

 During training, the cadets are involved in drills, physical training and sports activities that help to increase their fitness levels and develop discipline. They also learn military-related skills and knowledge such as the handling of the SAR21 rifle, marksmanship, orienteering, individual fieldcraft and urban operations.

The unit has many achievements over the years. Particularly in 2019, besides attaining Distinction for the Unit Recognition Award, our Freestyle Drill (FSD) team emerged as champions in the 11th NCC Freestyle Exhibition Drill Competition (East District) and our team of senior cadets came in first place in the Orienteering Competition. The Senior Cadet Leaders also conducted the 2nd Freestyle Drill Cluster Training for all NCC cadets of our school as well as Bedok South Secondary School.
