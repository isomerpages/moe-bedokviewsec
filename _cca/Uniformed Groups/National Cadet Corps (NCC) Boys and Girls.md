### CCA Overview &amp; Highlights


The National Cadet Corps (NCC) Boys’ unit aims to develop responsible and resilient leaders and team players through fun and challenging military-related activities. Through these activities, we hope to develop the boys to become self-motivated leaders who embody resilient minds, fit bodies and committed hearts to serve the unit, school and nation.

The cadets are involved in drills, physical trainings and fun sports activities during their training sessions to train up their fitness levels and develop discipline. They also learn military-related skills and knowledge such as technical handling of the SAR21 rifle, marksmanship, orienteering, individual fieldcraft and urban operations.

Our Precision Drill Squad (PDS) consist of a select group of cadets who are skilled in executing complex rifle drills with precision and fluidity. Cadets are auditioned and selected based on their rifle handling skills, drill sharpness and coordination. Our PDS are given a plethora of opportunities to participate in various events, which include competitions, National Day performance and East cluster training, where they conduct a session for an NCC unit from another school to learn and experience basic PDS training. As part of tradition, our PDS performed during a National Day Dinner at the new Siglap Community Club this year to commemorate both its grand opening and our nation’s independence.

The unit achieved the following awards in recent years and aims to continue to uphold high standards of the Corps:

*   Distinction for the Unit Recognition Award in 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022;    
*   Gold awards for GOTC II Virtual Competition in 2021;    
*   Silver and Bronze awards for GOTC II Virtual Competition in 2020;    
*   1st Runner-Up for Orienteering Competition in 2019
