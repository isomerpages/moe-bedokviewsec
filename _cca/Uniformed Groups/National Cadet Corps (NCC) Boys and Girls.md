<h3>CCA Overview &amp; Highlights</h3>
<p>The National Cadet Corps (NCC) Land unit aims to develop responsible and
resilient leaders and team players through fun and challenging military-related
activities. Through these activities, we hope to develop the boys to become
self-motivated leaders who embody resilient minds, fit bodies and committed
hearts to serve the unit, school and nation. During training sessions,
the cadets are involved in drills, physical training and sports activities
that help to increase their fitness levels and develop discipline. They
also learn military-related skills and knowledge such as the handling of
the SAR21 rifle, marksmanship, orienteering, individual fieldcraft and
urban operations. The cadets are given opportunities to enjoy the combined
Uniformed Group (UG) camp conducted in school and NCC HQ activities such
as Camp FORGE and Camp STEEL, the Senior Specialist Leaders’ Course, Sports
and Games Competitions, Orienteering Competition and Cluster Training sessions.
Our unit also consists of Precision Drill Squad (PDS) and Freestyle Drill
(FSD) teams. Cadets are auditioned and selected based on their drill sharpness
and coordination. Our PDS and FSD teams are given a plethora of opportunities
to participate in various events, which include competitions, National
Day performances and outreach programmes for primary school students. The
unit achieved the following awards in recent years and aims to continue
to uphold high standards of the Corps:</p>
