### CCA Overview &amp; Highlights


The National Cadet Corps (NCC) Land unit aims to develop responsible and resilient leaders and team players through fun and challenging military-related activities. Through these activities, we hope to develop the boys to become self-motivated leaders who embody resilient minds, fit bodies and committed hearts to serve the unit, school and nation.
During training sessions, the cadets are involved in drills, physical training and sports activities that help to increase their fitness levels and develop discipline. They also learn military-related skills and knowledge such as the handling of the SAR21 rifle, marksmanship, orienteering, individual fieldcraft and urban operations. The cadets are given opportunities to enjoy the combined Uniformed Group (UG) camp conducted in school and NCC HQ activities such as Camp FORGE and Camp STEEL, the Senior Specialist Leaders’ Course, Sports and Games Competitions, Orienteering Competition and Cluster Training sessions. 
Our unit also consists of Precision Drill Squad (PDS) and Freestyle Drill (FSD) teams. Cadets are auditioned and selected based on their drill sharpness and coordination. Our PDS and FSD teams are given a plethora of opportunities to participate in various events, which include competitions, National Day performances and outreach programmes for primary school students. 
The unit achieved the following awards in recent years and aims to continue to uphold high standards of the Corps:
* Distinction for the Unit Recognition Award in 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022;
* Champions (Girls) for Orienteering Competition in 2019
* 1st Runner-Up (Boys) for Orienteering Competition in 2019
* Champions in the 11th NCC FSD Competition (East District) in 2019
* Gold awards for GOTC II Virtual Competition in 2021 and 2022;
* Silver awards for GOTC II Virtual Competition in 2023;
* 2nd Runner-Up in the 12th NCC PDS Competition (East District) in 2023
* 10th in the 12th NCC PDS Competition Grand Finals in 2023

As of 2024, the NCC Land boys’ and girls’ units will merge as a combined mixed NCC Land unit. With the combined strengths of both boys and girls, we will achieve greater heights in years to come.
