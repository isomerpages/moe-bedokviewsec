### Overview

Our holistic PE curriculum enables our students to demonstrate individually and with others the physical skills, practices, and values to enjoy a lifetime of active, healthy living.

The approach that the PE department take to develop an active and healthy Bedok Viewan is to engage and motivate our students with:
1. Mastery - By developing our studentsâ€™ psychomotor skills and capabilities with a sense of progress. (Psychomotor domain)
 
3. Autonomy - By giving meaningful feedback, choice over how to do things, and encouragement to help our students make self-directed progress. (Affective domain)
 
5. Purpose - By inspiring our students to meet learning outcomes and maintain a healthy lifestyle with sustainable progress and resilience. (Cognitive domain)

**Physical Education Curriculum in Bedok View**

We have included Outdoor Education to develop a sense of adventure through the exploration of both natural and urban environments from their immediate surroundings to other unfamiliar locations in our students. Physical activities are promoted as students develop appropriate outdoor skills while cultivating an attitude of care and appreciation for the environment and thoughtful consideration of the risks and safety of self and others. 

Through the Physical Health & Fitness component in the PE curriculum, we make meaningful connections between health concepts and practical applications through experiential learning. Our focus is on developing our students to be self-directed learners who see meaning in their sustained physical endeavours, and accept responsibility for personal health and fitness. During the lessons, our students will learn to evaluate their lifestyle and adapt their participation in physical activities at different stages of their lives, and how living active and healthy lives is connected with the world around them and the health of others. 

For each level, we have different game modules as part of our PE curriculum. Progressive game skills and concepts are taught through different pedagogical approaches and strategies to cater to the different learning needs of our students. We have included skills assessment and online theory assessment at the end of each game module, so as to motivate them intrinsically by giving them autonomy, mastery and purpose in their learning to achieve the goals in PE.

**Goals of Physical Education**
