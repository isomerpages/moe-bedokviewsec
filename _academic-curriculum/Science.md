### Overview

The Science Department is led by our HOD Science and is supported by one SH Science. At Bedok View Secondary, we believe in nurturing our students to be scientifically literate, inquisitive and self-directed learners, with a lifelong passion for Science.

We adopt an Inquiry-Based Learning Approach in the teaching and learning of Science at all levels. Science knowledge and skills are nurtured and developed through these three broad platforms: Classroom Based, Laboratory Based and the Science Incubation Unit (SIU). Our SIU provides students with a holistic and integrated approach towards experiences in Applied Science Learning.

The department adopts a holistic system in the teaching of Lower Secondary Science for both the Express and Normal Academic streams. For the Upper Secondary Express students, the department offers Pure Biology, Chemistry, Physics as well as Combined Science (Physics and Chemistry) and Combined Science (Biology and Chemistry). For the Upper Secondary Normal Academic students, the department offers Combined Science (Physics and Chemistry). The department believes in giving equal opportunities for all students to learn Science so as to ensure that they have a well-rounded Science education.

**Vision**

Scientifically literate and Inquisitive Learner.

**Mission**

To nurture scientifically literate and self-directed learners who have a lifelong passion for Science. 


### Programmes

1. Science Experiential Workshop (SEW) (Secondary 1)
2. IgnITE Skills Challenge (for Secondary 2NA & 3NA)
3. Advanced Elective Module on STEM Related Areas (Secondary 3)
4. Science & Technology Competition @ Nanyang Polytechnic (Secondary 2 and 3 Selected Students

**1. Science Experiential Workshop (SEW) (Secondary 1)**

Secondary One students attend the in-house Science Experiential Workshop (SEW) to enrich and extend their learning beyond the syllabus. Students will be engaged with hands-on activities when they attend the workshop. Activities conducted in the past workshops include bridge-building using ice-cream sticks, crime scene investigation and slime-making.

**2. IgnITE Skills Challenge (for Secondary 2NA & 3NA)**

The ignITE Skills Challenge is a national-level skills competition organised by the Institute of Technical Education, Singapore, with support from the Ministry of Education and Singapore Science Centre. As the only national competition for Normal Academic and Technical students in Singapore, the aim is to excite students about the value of vocational and skills education, make learning enjoyable and memorable. Students can participate in more than 10 challenges that focus on Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).

**3. Advanced Elective Module on STEM Related Areas (Secondary 3)**

The Advanced Elective Module (AEM) is organised for our Secondary 3 Express Physics students. Students will spend 4 days at a selected Polytechnic during their June or September school holidays to attend the module. In attending this module, students have the chance to understand more about STEM-related skills as well as to have a first-hand experience of life in a Polytechnic. Some of these AEMs include Discovering the Science of Flight, The Science of Ship Design and Creative STEM Applications.

**4. Science & Technology Competition @Nanyang Polytechnic**

The Science and Technology Challenge is an annual competition organised by Nanyang Polytechnic. The aim of the competition is to fuel students' critical and creative thinking while promoting their interest in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).

In 2020, our students achieved the 2nd Runner Up in the category for “Build Your Dream Aircraft”.
