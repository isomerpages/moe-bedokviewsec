### Background

1 \. The National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) was launched in March 2020 to make digital learning inclusive by equipping students with the digital literacies to be future-ready.

2 \. Under the NDLP, MOE announced in 2020 that every student will own a school-prescribed personal learning device (PLD) by end-2021. Singapore Citizen students can use their Edusave Account to pay for the PLD.

3 \. The use of the personal learning devices for teaching and learning will

      1) support the development of digital literacies in our students,
      2) support self-directed and collaborative learning, and
      3) enhance teaching and learning

**6 \. Frequently Asked Questions**

**I. How do I check my child’s edusave balance? How much do I have to pay?** 

Parents may call this number 6260 0777 to check the edusave balance.  
  
All Singaporean students are supported by MOE in purchasing a device. They can tap on their Edusave Account to reduce their out-of-pocket (OOP) expenses when buying a device.  
  
For students from lower-income households, MOE will provide further subsidies so that they do not have to incur any OOP expenses. Students may approach their schools if they require financial assistance.  
  
Permanent residents (PR) and international students (IS) who need support could apply for subsidies, particularly those whose Gross Household Income (GHI) is below $4000 or Per Capita Income (PCI)# is below $1000. For more details, please approach the school

**II. What happens if the device is stolen/lost? Does the contract include insurance? If so, what is covered under the insurance**
