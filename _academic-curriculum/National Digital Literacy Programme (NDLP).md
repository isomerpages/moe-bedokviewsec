### Background

1 \. The National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) was launched in March 2020 to make digital learning inclusive by equipping students with the digital literacies to be future-ready.

2 \. Under the NDLP, MOE announced in 2020 that every student will own a school-prescribed personal learning device (PLD) by end-2021. Singapore Citizen students can use their Edusave Account to pay for the PLD.

3 \. The use of the personal learning devices for teaching and learning will

      1) support the development of digital literacies in our students,
      2) support self-directed and collaborative learning, and
      3) enhance teaching and learning
