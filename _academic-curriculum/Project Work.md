### Overview

Project Work is offered to all Secondary 2  students as part of the school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) - Tier 1. The programme provide students with opportunities to explore the inter-relationships and inter-connectedness of these subject-specific knowledge, while synthesizing their learning to apply on a selected problem. Through the programme students will be able to apply creative and critical thinking skills, improve their communication skills, foster their collaborative learning skills and develop self-directed inquiry and life-long learning skills.

The theme of Project Work, ‘Sustainability’, invites students to brainstorm on ideas and solutions to conserve the limited resources that Singapore has, through the Design Thinking framework. Lessons on sustainability, conservation and learning journeys through the lenses of different subjects are conducted, highlighting the multidisciplinary nature of Project Work.
