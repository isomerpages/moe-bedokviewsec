### Overview

The theme of Project Work, ‘Sustainability’, invites students to brainstorm on ideas and solutions to conserve the limited resources that Singapore has, through the Design Thinking framework. Lessons on sustainability, conservation and learning journeys through the lenses of different subjects are conducted, highlighting the multi-disciplinary nature of Project Work. This allows students to explore the inter-relationships and inter-connectedness of these subject-specific knowledge, while synthesizing their learning to apply on a selected problem. While some students craft proposals to engage the community, others creatively design and construct models of their own sustainable and smart communities. Their innovative skills are further honed through the presentation of their proposals and models using an engaging media platform.
